	abstract = {The current compliance networks of automatic air-quality monitoring stations in large urban environments are not sufficient to provide spatial and temporal measurement resolution for realistic assessment of personal exposure to pollutants. Small low-cost sensor platforms with greater mobility and expected lower maintenance costs, are increasingly being used as a supplement to compliance monitoring stations. However, low-cost sensor platforms usually provide data with uncertain precision. To improve the precision, these sensor platforms require in-field calibration. Our paper aims to demonstrate that data from each individual sensor system can be corrected using that sensor system's own data to achieve much improved data quality compared to a reference. However, in this procedure, there are practical difficulties such as individual sensor outputs from the multi-sensor system not being sufficiently available due to malfunctions for instance. We explore how this can be dealt with. In our opinion, this is a novel approach, of practical importance both to users and manufacturers. We present a detailed comparative analysis of Linear Regression (univariate), Multivariate Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks used with a specific aim of calibrating field-deployed low-cost CO and O3 sensors. For Artificial Neural Network models, the performance of three common training algorithms was compared (Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient back-propagation and Conjugate Gradient Powell-Beale algorithm). Data for this study were obtained from two campaigns conducted with 25 multi-sensor AQMESH v.3.5 platforms used within the activities of the CITI-SENSE project. The platforms were co-located to reference gas monitors at the Automatic Monitoring Station Stari Grad, in Belgrade, Serbia. This paper demonstrates that Multivariate Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Network calibration models can improve the output signal. This improvement can be measured by changes in the median and interquartile ranges of statistical parameters used for model evaluation. Artificial Neural Networks showed the best results compared to Linear Regression and Multivariate Linear Regression models. The best predictors for CO, in addition to CO low-cost sensor data, were PM2.5 and NO2, while for O3, in addition to O3 low-cost sensor data, the most suitable input predictors were NO and aH. Based on residual error analysis, we have shown that for CO and O3, a certain range of concentrations exists in which calibrated values differ by less than 10\% from the reference method results. In addition, it was noted that for all models, CO sensors consistently showed lower variability between platforms compared to O3 sensors.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} With the completion of the Beijing Five-year Clean Air Action Plan by the end of 2017, the annual mean PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations in Beijing dropped dramatically to 58.0 μg/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ in 2017 from 89.5 μg/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ in 2013. However, controversies exist to argue that favorable meteorological conditions in 2017 that helped pollution dispersion were the major factor for such rapid decrease in PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations. To comprehensively evaluate this five-year plan, we employed Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filtering and a WRF-CMAQ model to quantify the relative contribution of meteorological conditions and the control of anthropogenic emissions to PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ reduction in Beijing from 2013 to 2017. For these five years, the relative contribution of emission-reduction measures to the decrease of PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations in Beijing calculated by KZ filtering and the WRF-CMAQ model was 80.6 \% and 78.6 \% respectively. The WRF-CMAQ model further revealed that local and regional emission-reduction measures contributed to 53.7 \% and 24.9 \% of the PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ reduction respectively. For local emission-reduction measures, the regulation of coal boilers, increasing clean fuels for residential use, industrial restructuring, the regulation of raise dust and vehicle emissions contributed to 20.1 \%, 17.4 \%, 10.8 \%, 3.0 \% and 2.4 \% of PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ reduction respectively. Both models suggested that the control of anthropogenic emissions contributed to around 80 \% of the total decrease in PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations in Beijing, indicating that emission control was crucial for the notable improvement in air quality in Beijing from 2013 to 2017. Therefore, such long-term air quality clean plan should be continued for the future years to further reduce PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations in Beijing. Considering that different emission-reduction measures exert distinct effects on PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ reduction and existing emission-reduction measures work poorly to reduce ozone concentrations, future strategies for emission-reduction should be designed and implemented accordingly.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Coarse particulate matter (PM10) concentration data from the national regulatory monitoring network for 12 years (2004–2015) were systematically analyzed to determine broad trends. Less than 1\% of all PM10 measurements (11 out of 4789) were found to meet the annual average WHO Air Quality Guideline (20 μg/m3), while 19\% of the locations were in compliance with the Indian air quality standards for PM10 (60 μg/m3). Further efforts are necessary to improve measurement coverage and quality including the use of hybrid monitoring systems, harmonized approaches for sampling and data analysis, and easier data accessibility.},

The chapter discusses the use of popular education approaches to facilitate more effective collaboration and optimize mutual co-learning among community members and their project partners. It also explores how, by using this approach, community members can contribute their own knowledge and awareness of environmental and health conditions to advance the research and education process, thereby increasing the EHL of their academically-credentialed partners.Examples from several community-engaged research and education projects are shared to illustrate the versatility of these approaches as a means of raising EHL in a variety of contexts, including researcher-initiated scientific studies, community-initiated trainings, and co-initiated research projects. The case studies demonstrate how popular education and community-engaged research approaches can contribute to building and sustaining more equitable partnerships between impacted communities and their partners (who may be based in varied institutional settings such as academia, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations), with an emphasis on mutual co-learning and knowledge co-creation among community and academically-credentialed partners as key drivers of increased EHL.},

	abstract = {In November of 1999, four permanent surface stations were installed in the vicinity of the surface ozone monitoring station on the summit of the Cerro Tololo (2200 m MSL) in Chile at 30degreesS. These stations were used to study the atmospheric flow conditions, which are important for the interpretation of the ozone measurements at Cerro Tololo. In addition, radiosonde ascents were performed in March of 2000 near the coast and about 60 km inland. Different wind regimes were distinguished. Above 4 km MSL, large-scale westerly winds prevailed, while northerly winds were observed in a band along the coastline between 2- and 4-km-MSL height. The upper boundary of the northerly wind regime corresponded to the mean height of the Andes mountain range. This wind regime resulted from the westerly winds being blocked and forced to flow in parallel to the Andes (when Froude number is less than 1). The phenomenon was also confirmed by model simulations. Seasonally varying, thermally induced valley winds and a sea breeze developed below the northerly wind regime. In summer, the valley winds reached the Cerro Tololo. Diurnal variation of the top boundary of the valley winds also influenced the lower boundary of the northerly wind regime, which was less than 2 km MSL during the night and greater than 2 km MSL during the day. Thus, this observational and modeling study has shown that in summer the baseline ozone monitoring site at Cerro Tololo can be contaminated by polluted air that is transported from the plains by the thermally induced wind systems.},

These changes explain most of the wintertime variability of the ozone data at CT. Since the wintertime data show no significant diurnal cycle, local circulations and in situ photochemical processes cannot account for the sudden changes in ozone. Rather, a synoptic-scale forcing of the changes is described on the basis of composite analyses of reanalysis data. Synoptic configurations associated with sudden changes in ozone were separated into W and D cases, according to the local evolution of humidity. W cases are characterized by humidity values in excess of 4 hPa lasting one or two days before the ozone maximum. D cases show no significant change in humidity before the ozone maximum. Both in Wand in D cases, stratospheric air appears to be advected from polar latitudes to midlatitudes and subtropical latitudes during the development of cutoff lows and deep troughs. The origin of the air arriving at CT during a W and a D case study was assessed using mesoscale numerical simulations. The model calculations for the W case show a deep stratospheric intrusion reaching the lower troposphere in subtropical latitudes during the amplification and mature stages of a cutoff low. For D cases the stratospheric intrusion is mostly confined to midlatitudes and to an oceanic area far from the site of study. Analyses of trajectories show that in both cases, high ozone mixing ratios at the surface occur in connection with air parcels having a stratospheric history.},

Comparison among inventories suggests that major uncertainties are linked to inadequate emission factors for CO and inadequate activity data for NOx. These results, in combination with previous studies, suggest that current NOx emissions are overestimated by a factor of up to 3 in Santiago and Sao Paulo, and Buenos Aires shows a slight overestimate by 20\%. In the case of Bogota we suspect that the current CO emission inventory is overestimated.

By forcing a biogeochemical model with our new data set and using this model's results to guide a millennial-scale Earth System Model simulation, we calculate the impact of enhanced glacial oceanic iron deposition on the LGM-Holocene carbon cycle. On centennial timescales, the higher LGM dust deposition results in a weak reduction of {\textless}10 ppm in atmospheric CO2 due to enhanced efficiency of the biological pump. This is followed by a further similar to 10 ppm reduction over millennial timescales due to greater carbon burial and carbonate compensation.},

In this work, we analyse 260 soundings compiled over the period 1994–2014, and make the data available for the international community. We characterise O 3 profiles over this remote area of the Pacific by means of statistical analyses that consider, on the one hand, a traditional climatology that describes the data in terms of seasonal cycles based on monthly averages and, on the other hand, a process-oriented analysis based on self-organising maps. Our analyses show the influence of both tropical and subtropical/mid-latitude air masses at Rapa Nui. The former occurs in summer and fall when convective conditions prevail, and the latter in late winter and spring when subsiding conditions are recurrent. The occurrence of stratospheric intrusions in late winter and spring in connection with deep troughs and the presence of the subtropical jet stream is also apparent in the data set. The tropospheric ozone column is in good agreement with the corresponding data derived from satellites but with a systematic overestimate of summer and fall values. There is evidence of an upward trend in ozone near the surface, which suggests the impact of local pollution. We look forward to an enhancement of the Rapa Nui observing site, given its location that offers a privileged position to observe climate change over the sparsely sampled and vast South Pacific Ocean.

This region is characterized by strong coastal upwelling, the coolest SSTs in the tropical belt, and is home to the largest subtropical stratocumulus deck on Earth. The field intensive phase of VOCALS-REx took place during October and November 2008 and constitutes a critical part of a broader CLIVAR program (VOCALS) designed to develop and promote scientific activities leading to improved understanding, model simulations, and predictions of the southeastern Pacific (SEP) coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system, on diurnal to interannual timescales. The other major components of VOCALS are a modeling program with a model hierarchy ranging from the local to global scales, and a suite of extended observations from regular research cruises, instrumented moorings, and satellites. The two central themes of VOCALS-REx focus upon (a) links between aerosols, clouds and precipitation and their impacts on marine stratocumulus radiative properties, and (b) physical and chemical couplings between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere, including the role that mesoscale ocean eddies play. A set of hypotheses designed to be tested with the combined field, monitoring and modeling work in VOCALS is presented here. A further goal of VOCALS-REx is to provide datasets for the evaluation and improvement of large-scale numerical models. VOCALS-REx involved five research aircraft, two ships and two surface sites in northern Chile.

	abstract = {This study presents a system to predict high pollution events that develop in connection with enhanced subsidence due to coastal lows, particularly in winter over Santiago de Chile. An accurate forecast of these episodes is of interest since the local government is entitled by law to take actions in advance to prevent public exposure to PM10 concentrations in excess of 150 mu g m(-3) (24 h running averages). The forecasting system is based on accurately simulating carbon monoxide (CO) as a PM10/PM2.5 surrogate, since during episodes and within the city there is a high correlation (over 0.95) among these pollutants. Thus, by accurately forecasting CO, which behaves closely to a tracer on this scale, a PM estimate can be made without involving aerosol-chemistry modeling. Nevertheless, the very stable nocturnal conditions over steep topography associated with maxima in concentrations are hard to represent in models. Here we propose a forecast system based on the WRF-Chem model with optimum settings, determined through extensive testing, that best describe both meteorological and air quality available measurements. Some of the important configurations choices involve the boundary layer (PBL) scheme, model grid resolution (both vertical and horizontal), meteorological initial and boundary conditions and spatial and temporal distribution of the emissions. A forecast for the 2008 winter is performed showing that this forecasting system is able to perform similarly to the authority decision for PM10 and better than persistence when forecasting PM10 and PM2.5 high pollution episodes. Problems regarding false alarm predictions could be related to different uncertainties in the model such as day to day emission variability, inability of the model to completely resolve the complex topography and inaccuracy in meteorological initial and boundary conditions. Finally, according to our simulations, emissions from previous days dominate episode concentrations, which highlights the need for 48 h forecasts that can be achieved by the system presented here. This is in fact the largest advantage of the proposed system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Several approaches have been used to deal with this problem: coarsening the spatial resolution of emissions; adding spatial correlations to the covariance matrices; adding constraints on the spatial derivatives into the functional being minimized; and multiplying the emission error covariance matrix by weighting factors. Intercomparison of methods for a carbon monoxide inversion over a city shows that even though all methods diminish the colocalization problem and produce similar general patterns, detailed information can greatly change according to the method used ranging from smooth, isotropic and short range modifications to not so smooth, non-isotropic and long range modifications. Poisson (non-Gaussian) and Gaussian assumptions both show these patterns, but for the Poisson case the emissions are naturally restricted to be positive and changes are given by means of multiplicative correction factors, producing results closer to the true nature of emission errors. Finally, we propose and test a new two-step, two-scale, fully Bayesian approach that deals with the colocalization problem and can be implemented for any prior density distribution.},

	abstract = {Air quality networks need revision and optimisation as instruments and network requirements, both scientific and societal, evolve over time. Assessing and optimising the information content of a monitoring network is a non-trivial problem. Here, we introduce a methodology formulated in a variational framework using an air quality model to simulate the dispersion of carbon monoxide (CO) as a passive tracer at the city scale. We address the specific case of adding or removing stations, and the more general situation of optimally distributing a given number of stations in a domain taking into account transport patterns and spatial factors such as population density and emission patterns. We consider three quality indicators: precision gain, information gain and degrees of freedom for a signal. These metrics are all functions of the singular values of the sensitivity matrix that links emissions and observations in the variational framework. We illustrate the application of the methodology in the case of Santiago (33.5 degrees S, 70.5 degrees W, 500m a.s.l.), a city of ca. 7 million inhabitants with significant pollution levels. We deem information gain as the best of the above indicators for this case. We then quantify the actual evolution of Santiago's network and compare it with the optimal configuration suggested by our methodology and with results previously obtained using a statistical approach. The application is restricted to diurnal and summer conditions, for which the dispersion model shows a good agreement with observations. The current method offers advantages in that it allows extending a network to include new sites, and it explicitly considers the effects of dispersion patterns, and desired weighting functions such as emission fluxes and population density. We find that Santiago's air quality has improved two-fold since 1988, regarding CO under diurnal summer conditions. Still, according to our results, the current configuration could be improved by integrating more suburban stations in the southwest of the basin.},

Air pollution associated with biomass burning and urban emissions affects extensive areas of South America. We focus on black carbon (BC) aerosol and its impacts on air quality, water availability, and climate, with an emphasis on the Andean cryosphere. BC is one of the key short-lived climate pollutants that is a topic of growing interest for near-term mitigation of these issues. Limited scientific evidence indicates that the Andean cryosphere has already responded to climate change with receding glaciers and snow cover, which directly affect water resources, agriculture, and energy production in the Andean region of South America. Despite the paucity of systematic observations along the Andes, a few studies have detected BC on snow and glaciers in the Andes. These, in addition to existing and projected emissions and weather patterns, suggest a possible contribution of BC to the observed retreat of the Andean cryosphere. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of these issues from scientific and policy perspectives, and propose strategic expansions to the relevant measurement infrastructure in the region.},

	abstract = {An outstanding meteorological feature appearing off the coast in Central and Northern Chile is the persistent stratus cloud deck under the subtropical Pacific High. It has a large impact on the regional and global energy balance and atmospheric circulation. In connection with mid-latitude synoptic-scale disturbances, subsiding easterly flow down the subtropical Andes often occurs in Northern Chile allowing large anthropogenic emissions of oxidized sulfur that take place in the region to reach the stratus deck. We explore the potential impact of anthropogenic emitted sulfur on the stratus deck associated with strong easterly flow events that occur on the average 4 to 8 times per year. A representative transport event is simulated using a 3-D transport chemistry model and the results are compared with satellite observations of cloud droplet number concentration. Although not conclusive, this preliminary study reveals a potential perturbation of the subtropical stratocumulus deck due to anthropogenic sulfur aerosols.},

Wearables are promising (e.g., on wristbands, attached to belts or backpacks) to integrate commercial off-the-shelf gas sensors for personal air pollution sensing. Yet previous research lacks comprehensive investigations on the accuracies of air pollution sensing on wearables. In response, we proposed W-Air, an accurate personal multi-pollutant monitoring platform for wearables. We discovered that human emissions introduce non-linear interference when low-cost gas sensors are integrated into wearables, which is overlooked in existing studies. W-Air adopts a sensor-fusion calibration scheme to recover high-fidelity ambient pollutant concentrations from the human interference. It also leverages a neural network with shared hidden layers to boost calibration parameter training with fewer measurements and utilizes semi-supervised regression for calibration parameter updating with little user intervention. We prototyped W-Air on a wristband with low-cost gas sensors. Evaluations demonstrated that W-Air reports accurate measurements both with and without human interference and is able to automatically learn and adapt to new environments.},

Recently, there is a growing interest in developing low-cost sensors, installed on moving vehicles, for fine-grained air quality measurement. However, low-cost mobile sensors typically suffer from low accuracy and thus need careful calibration to preserve a high measurement quality. In this paper, we propose a two-phase data calibration method consisting of a linear part and a nonlinear part. We use MLS (multiple least square) to train the linear part, and use RF (random forest) to train the nonlinear part. We propose an automatic feature selection algorithm based on AIC (Akaike information criterion) for the linear model, which helps avoid overfitting due to the inclusion of inappropriate features. We evaluate our method extensively. Results show that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving an overall accuracy improvement of 16.4\% in terms of PM2.5 levels compared with state-of-the-art approach.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare personal exposure to particulate matter (fine and ultrafine particles) in commuters using different transport modes (bicycle, bus, car and subway) in a busy, assigned route in downtown Santiago, Chile. Volunteers carrying personal samplers completed scheduled commutes during the morning rush hours, while central site measurements were conducted in parallel. A total of 137 valid commutes were assessed. The impact of central site, traffic and other variables was explored with regression models. PM2.5 personal concentrations were equal to or slightly above central site measurements, while UFP personal concentrations were above them. Regression models showed impacts of both background levels and traffic emissions on personal PM2.5 and UFP exposure. Traffic impacts varied with transport modes. Estimates of traffic impacts on personal PM2.5 exposure were 2.0, 13.0, 16.9 and 17.5 μg m−3, for car, bicycle, subway and bus, respectively; while for UFP exposure were 8400, 16200, 25600 and 30100 counts per cm3, for subway, car, bicycle and bus, respectively. After controlling the central site and transport mode, higher temperatures increased PM2.5 exposure and decreased UFP ones, while the wind direction affected UFP personal exposure. In conclusion, we found significant impacts of both central site background measurements and traffic emissions on personal exposure of volunteer commuters in an assigned route in Santiago, with impacts varying with transport modes.},

On-road emissions from four, heavy-duty diesel truck engines were measured. The same engines were reevaluated in the manufacturers' laboratories. For highway cruise and acceleration conditions, all engines produced bimodal size distributions with the nuclei mode ranging in size from 6 to 11 nm and the accumulation mode from 52 to 62 nm. On-road size distribution measurements nearly always showed a nuclei mode while laboratory measurements showed a nuclei mode under many, but not all conditions. Laboratory studies showed that nuclei mode particles consisted mainly of heavy hydrocarbons. More than 97\% of the volume of 12 and 30 nm particles disappeared on heating to 400 °C. The volatility resembled that of C24-C32 n-alkanes implying a significant contribution from lubricating oil.},

	abstract = {Policies to reduce outdoor air pollution concentrations are often assessed on the basis of the regulated pollutants. Whether these are the most appropriate components to assess the potential health benefits is questionable, as other health-relevant pollutants may be more strongly related to traffic.

The aim of this study is to compare the contrast in concentration between major roads and (sub)urban background for a large range of pollutants and to analyze the magnitude of the measured difference in the street – background for major streets with different street configurations.

Measurements of PM10, PM2.5, particle number concentrations (PNC), black carbon (BC), elemental composition of PM10 and PM2.5 and NOx were conducted simultaneously in eight major streets and nine (sub)urban background locations in the Netherlands. Measurements were done six times for a week during a six month period in 2008.

High contrasts between busy streets and background locations in the same city were found for chromium, copper and iron (factor 2–3). These elements were especially present in the coarse fraction of PM. In addition, high contrasts were found for BC and NOx (factor 1.8), typically indicators of direct combustion emissions. The contrast for PNC was similar to BC. NO2 contrast was lower (factor 1.5). The largest contrast was found for two street canyons and two streets with buildings at one side of the street only.

The contrast between busy streets and urban background in NO2 was less than the contrast found for BC, PNC and elements indicative of non-exhaust emissions, adding evidence that NO2 is not representing (current) traffic well. The study supports a substantial role for non-exhaust emissions including brake- and tyre wear and road dust in addition to direct combustion emissions. Significant underestimation of disease burden may occur when relying too much on the regulated components.},

The explosion of Deepwater Horizon was yet another incident revealing the dangers involved in the hunt for fossil fuels. Despite the public attention and outrage at these events, neither the concept of environmental citizenship, nor the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has prevailed in the struggle against environmental degradation. Economic growth offsets efficiency gains, while strategies for energy sufficiency are usually not seriously considered. Action toward a more sustainable society, for example, a 2000 W- and 1 ton CO2-society, must be taken by individuals but further incentives must be set. In order to provide individuals with detailed information about their mitigation options, we took the results from a survey of environmental behavior of 3369 Swiss Citizens, and combined them with life cycle assessment. Our results from this bottom-up approach show a huge bandwidth of the ecological footprints among the individuals interviewed. We conclude that a continuous consumption of not more than 2000 W per person seems possible for the major part of the population in this society. However, it will be far more difficult not to exceed 1 ton CO2 per capita.},

A weekday-weekend effect in ozone, caused by lower NOx emissions due to reduced diesel truck traffic in the weekends, has been previously observed in Los Angeles and other cities. Measurements in the Caldecott tunnel show that emission ratios of VOCs do not vary with the day of the week, but measurements during CalNex2010 show a VOC weekday-weekend effectthrough faster photochemical processing at lower ambient NOx mixing ratios. Ambient VOC enhancement ratios of long-lived species such as benzene are the same between weekdays and weekends, whereas enhancement ratios of short-lived species, such as trimethyl benzene, are up to a factor of three lower on weekends.Based upon the observed differences in VOC enhancement ratios to CO, we determine that photochemical processing was on average 65\%-75\% faster on weekends during CalNex2010, which indicates thatambient OH radical concentrations were larger by this factor causing the observed change in VOC composition. A box model calculation based on the Master Chemical Mechanism was used to verify the increase in photochemical processing in the weekends.},

A methodology was developed to simultaneously evaluate the NOx and DPM control performance of miniature 4WCFS made from acicular mullite, an advanced ceramic material (ACM), that were challenged with diesel exhaust. The impact of catalyst loading and substrate porosity on catalytic performance of the NOx trap was evaluated. Simultaneously with NOx measurements, the real-time solid particle filtration performance of catalyst-coated standard and high porosity filters was determined for steady-state and regenerative conditions. The use of high porosity ACM 4-way catalyzed filtration systems reduced NOx by 99\% and solid and total particulate matter by 95\% when averaged over 10 regeneration cycles. A ?regeneration cycle? refers to an oxidizing (?lean?) exhaust condition followed by a reducing (?rich?) exhaust condition resulting in NOx storage and NOx reduction (i.e., trap ?regeneration?), respectively. Standard porosity ACM 4-way catalyzed filtration systems reduced NOx by 60?75\% and exhibited 99.9\% filtration efficiency. The rich/lean cycling used to regenerate the filter had almost no impact on solid particle filtration efficiency but impacted NOx control. Cycling resulted in the formation of very low concentrations of semivolatile nucleation mode particles for some 4WCFS formulations. Overall, 4WCFS show promise for significantly reducing diesel emissions into the atmosphere in a single control device.},

	abstract = {Surface ozone (O3), black carbon (BC) concentration and their relationship were established with PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentration at Mohal (31.9°N, 77.12°E, 1154 m amsl), a semi-urban site, in the Kullu valley of the northwestern part of the Indian Himalaya during January to December, 2010. O3 showed highest diurnal variation (84 ppb) during daytime and lowest (10 ppb) during late evening as well as early morning hours. The maximum concentration of O3 during summer was influenced by meteorological parameters, high insolation and backward airmass trajectories with transported pollutants. Rate of increase of O3 was observed as high as 2.92 ppb h−1 in October, followed by 2.73 ppb h−1 in March and 2.71 ppb h−1 in May. However, it was low 1.89 ppb h−1 in February. Monthly average concentration of O3 showed distinct seasonal variations with maximum in summer (55.9 ± 9.3 ppb in May) and minimum in winter (30.0 ± 6.2 ppb in January). Most of the O3 episodes were observed in summer during fair weather conditions like high solar flux (480–500 W m−2), relatively high temperature (22–24 °C) and negligible rainfall. By applying backward trajectory Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, the origin of the airmasses contributing to the background O3 concentration was investigated. O3 showed negative correlation with BC (r = −0.42). BC contributed 10–20\% and 14–42\% to the total aerosol mass concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 respectively which showed positive correlation (r = 0.65) with PM10 as well as PM2.5 aerosol mass concentration.},

	abstract = {The hygroscopic properties of submicrometer urban aerosol particles were studied during the 2009 Mirage-Shanghai Campaign. The urban aerosols were composed of more-hygroscopic and nearly-hydrophobic particles, together with a trace of less-hygroscopic particles. The mean hygroscopicity parameter κ of the more-hygroscopic mode varied in the range of 0.27–0.39 depending on particle size. The relative abundance of the more-hygroscopic particles at any size was ca. 70\%, slightly increasing with particle size. The number fraction of the nearly-hydrophobic particles fluctuated between 0.1 and 0.4 daily, in accordance with traffic emissions and atmospheric diffusion. The results from relative humidity dependence on hygroscopic growth and chemical analysis of fine particles indicated that particulate nitrate formation through the homogenous gas-phase reaction was suppressed under ammonia-deficient atmosphere in summer whereas the equilibrium was broken by more available NH3 during adverse meteorological conditions.},

	abstract = {There is evidence of adverse health impacts from human exposure to traffic-related ultrafine particulate matter pollution. As more commuters are spending a significant portion of their daily routine inside vehicles, it is increasingly relevant to study exposure levels to harmful pollutants inside the vehicle microenvironment. This study is one of the first research efforts to combine detailed freewaytraffic data (at 20 second intervals) and in-vehicle ultrafine particulate (UFP) exposure data under varying vehicle ventilation conditions. Results show that due to negative correlation between traffic speed and density, traffic states have a small but significant impact on in-vehicle UFP concentrations, highest in high traffic flow-high speed conditions or in high traffic density-low speed conditions. Vehicle cabin barrier effects are the primary determinant of in-vehicle exposure concentrations, providing 15\% protection with the windows down, 47\% protection with the windows up and the vent open, and 83-90\% protection with the windows up and the vent closed (more with the air conditioning on). Unique results from this study include the dominance of ventilation over traffic effects on UFP and the non-linear relationships between traffic variables and UFP concentrations. The results of this research have important implications for exposure modeling and potential exposure mitigation strategies.},

The OA and BC concentrations measured during the burning cycle of the log wood burner, batch wise fueled with wood logs, were highly variable and generally dominated by BC. The emissions of the pellet burner had, besides inorganic material, a high fraction of OA and a minor contribution of BC. However, during artificially induced poor burning BC was the dominating species with {\textasciitilde}80\% of the measured mass. The elemental O:C ratio of the OA was generally found in the range of 0.2 - 0.5 during the startup phase or after reloading the log wood burner. During the burnout or smoldering phase, O:C ratios increased up to 1.6 - 1.7, which is similar to the ratios found for the pellet boiler during stable burning conditions and higher than the O:C ratios observed for highly aged ambient OA. The organic emissions of both burners have a very similar H:C ratio at a given O:C ratio and therefore fall on the same line in the Van Krevelen diagram.},

Biodiesel has been proven to be a suitable alternative to petrodiesel and blending up to 20\% biodiesel with petrodiesel is policy promoted in the USA and the EU. To investigate the influence of blends on the exhaust emissions and possible health effects, we performed a series of studies with several engines (Euro 0, III and IV) using blends of rapeseed-derived biodiesel and petrodiesel. Regulated and non-regulated exhaust compounds were measured and their mutagenic effects were determined using the Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames-Test) according to OECD Guideline 471. Exhaust emissions of blends were approximately linearly dependent on the blend composition, particularly when considering regulated emissions. However, a negative effect of blends was observed with respect to mutagenicity of the exhaust emissions. In detail, an increase of the mutagenic potential was found for blends with the maximum observed for B20. From this point of view, B20 must be considered as a critical blend when petrodiesel and biodiesel are used as binary mixtures.},

Traffic was measured by vehicle counters at different places within the street. Traffic speed was monitored as well. The measuring campaign was conducted in the period June–July 1999 but only data from a selected intensive observation period are used in this study. This period was selected to suit conditions required for study of the traffic produced turbulence and the thermal effects and is characterised by quite low wind speeds. The data are used here for examination of concentration distributions in the street. Measurements are compared to model results calculated by a simple parameterised model, the Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM) and a 3-D CFD model MISKAM. Both models reproduce reasonably well the observed distribution of pollutants in the street. Due to predominantly low wind speed conditions, such effects as the traffic produced turbulence play a quite significant role. The model results provided by MISKAM are scaled using a velocity scale depending on the traffic produced turbulence. Application of a scaling velocity depending on wind speed only, provides unrealistic results.},

	abstract = {In 1997, a measuring campaign was conducted in a street canyon (Runeberg Street) in Helsinki. Hourly street level measurements and on-site electronic traffic counts were conducted throughout the whole of 1997; roof level measurements were conducted for approximately two months during the so-called intensive measuring campaign, from 3 March to 30 April 1997. Hourly mean concentrations of NOx, NO2, O3 and CO were measured at street and roof levels; the relevant hourly meteorological parameters were measured at roof level. We present here an evaluation of the Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM) street canyon dispersion model against the data measured during the whole of 1997. As the roof level concentrations and meteorological measurements were not available for the whole year, we utilised computed or meteorologically pre-processed values. The use of modelled urban background concentrations and meteorological values (instead of on-site roof level measurements) did not lessen the agreement between modelled and measured average concentration values at street level. The agreement between the temporal variations of predictions and measured data was also fairly good; for instance, the corresponding index of agreement values for NOx, NO2 and CO were 0.89, 0.81 and 0.87, respectively. However, as expected, the agreement in the temporal variations was somewhat better using actual measured on-site data during the intensive measuring campaign, than when using modelled urban background concentrations and meteorological values. This study demonstrates that it is possible to utilise the street canyon dispersion model OSPM with reasonable accuracy using modelled urban background and pre-processed meteorological values as model input.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous measurements of particle size distribution (size/range 10-700 nm) inside an urban street canyon and a nearby urban background location in Copenhagen in May-November 2001 were used to separate the traffic source contribution in the street canyon from the background levels. The background concentrations are highly variable due to changing contributions from long-range transport and local sources showing a diurnal pattern with a shift to smaller particle sizes during midday hours. The average ratio background/street concentration is 0.26 for NOx and 0.35, 0.42, 0.60, 0.64, respectively, for CO, total particle number (ToN), surface and volume.
The particle size distribution of the traffic source shows during daytime and evening hours (6-24) a maximum at particle sizes of 20-30 nm independent of the changing heavy-duty vehicle share during the same time interval. The particle number concentration highly correlated (R{\textgreater}0.83) with NOx through a wide range of particle sizes. The method of inverse modelling was applied to estimate average fleet emission factors typical of urban conditions in Denmark. Emission factors per average vehicle were estimated as (2.8±0.5)×1014 particles/km, (1.3±0.2) g NOx/(veh km) and (11±2) g CO/(veh km).
We observe two types of [`]nanoparticle events' (a) in background, probably due to photochemistry and (b) in the night hours when traffic is dominated by diesel taxis. During night hours (0-5), the maximum in the emitted particle size distribution is shifted to smaller sizes of about 15-18 nm. This shift to smaller particle sizes is related to an increase in the average NOx and ToN emission per vehicle by a factor of 2-3 and a reduced CO emission also by a factor of 2-3.},

	abstract = {Biomass burning for domestic heating has increased in many countries with cold climates in recent years. This paper presents and compares two ways of estimating the contribution of particulate matter (PM(2.5)) to ambient air from local domestic wood burning, using daily stationary parallel PM(2.5) measurements in a wood-burning area and at a reference location. In the first method (based on air mass back trajectories), daily gravimetric PM(2.5) mass differences were compared between the two stations for days with low contributions from regional sources. In the second method, 28 filters from each location were chemically analysed, and source contributions were calculated using positive matrix factorisation (PMF). The trajectory method estimated the extra local contribution from domestic wood burning in the wood-burning area to be 0.7-1.1 μg m(-3), while the PMF method gave a contribution of 0.64 μg m(-3). With the PMF method, the total contribution to ambient air from local domestic wood burning was estimated to be 25\% of the total PM(2.5) mass. The estimated mass contribution using the trajectory method gave a result similar to that of the PMF method, and the method can therefore be a time- and cost-effective first step, especially when no chemical analysis is possible.},

	abstract = {This article examines the influence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) on the synoptic weather types over New Zealand. The effects of ENSO (indicated by the Southern Oscillation Index, SOI), SAM and IPO on the occurrence of synoptic types are estimated in a holistic framework using the maximum likelihood method via applications of generalized linear models, both annually and by seasons. The average within-class variations in the intensity and air-mass characteristics (as expressed in the Auckland Airport meteorological variables) of synoptic systems were examined for individual types at the annual level. The results show that ENSO, SAM and IPO have significant effects on the probability of occurrence and to lesser degree the intensity and air-mass characteristics of some synoptic types. The effects vary considerably with seasons, synoptic types and phases of SOI, SAM and IPO and it is the confounding effects of different large-scale modes that lead to the observed changes in the type frequencies. The findings, with respect to ENSO and SAM in all cases and for IPO at the seasonal level, are in good agreement with the literature. However, the annual changes in type frequencies associated with the 1976/1977 IPO phase shift do not support the observed changes in the strength of anomalous southwesterly windflows over New Zealand, and the influence of the recent negative IPO phase also appears different from what we expect based on the existing research. It appears that the interaction between IPO and ENSO is important for understanding the observed climatic effects of IPO on New Zealand's weather and climate. This aspect deserves further attention in future studies. The findings from this work have important methodological and practical implications for New Zealand climate research.

	abstract = {Nanoparticle and gas-phase emission factors are presented for a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) passenger vehicle and are compared to gasoline operation. A bi-fuel LPG-gasoline vehicle certified for use on either fuel was used as the test vehicle so that a direct comparison of the emissions could be made based on fuel choice. These values were considered along with previous studies to determine the relative change in particulate emissions due to fuel choice over a wide range of vehicles and operating conditions. The vehicle examined in this study was tested on a chassis dynamometer for both steadystate and transient conditions. Transient test cycles included the US FTP72 driving cycle, Japanese driving cycle and modified Indian driving cycle while steady-state tests were done at vehicle speeds ranging from 10–90 km/hr in various transmission gears. Exhaust particle size distributions were measured in real-time using a differential mobility spectrometer (DMS50), and particle number and particle mass emission factors were calculated. For both fuels, the majority of the particles ranged from 5 to 160 nm in terms of particle diameter, with typically more than 85\% of the particles in the nucleation mode (between 5–50 nm). In most cases, the vehicle produced a greater fraction of larger (accumulation mode) particles when fuelled on LPG. Using the data in the literature as well as the data in the current study, gasoline fuel produces 4.6 times more particles in terms of number and 2.1 times more particles in terms of mass.},

	doi = {10.1080/01431161.2012.714500},
	abstract = {Hong Kong, located adjacent to the rapidly growing urban-industrial region of south China, provides a case of mixed aerosol types (urban, industrial, marine, and long-distance, including dust) from diverse activities and has suffered many serious air pollution episodes over the last decade. However, the sources and transport pathways of aerosols measured and recorded in Hong Kong have not been well researched due to the lack of air quality monitoring stations in east Asia. Here, an integrated method combining Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data, backward trajectories, and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) modelling is used to identify probable transport pathways and magnitudes of source contributions for four characteristic aerosol types. These types, which are dominant in Hong Kong during defined climatic and environmental conditions, are urban fine aerosols, urban mixed aerosols, dust, and heavy pollution. They were defined by clustering a total of 730 AERONET data sets between 2005 and 2008. Results show that aerosol types 1 and 2 (urban fine and urban mixed) are associated with regional fine particulate urban emissions and predominantly local urban emissions, respectively, suggesting that mitigating measures taken within Hong Kong itself would be partially effective. Heavy pollution and dust (types 4 and 3) are more associated with short- and long-distance sources, notably heavy industries in nearby southern Guangdong and the Pearl River Delta region, and desert dust from arid regions in north China. The PSCF map representing dust aerosol type shows a wide range of eastward and southeastward trajectories from northwest China to Hong Kong. Although the contribution of dust sources is small compared to anthropogenic aerosols, a serious recent dust outbreak observed in Hong Kong was associated with an elevation of the air pollution index to 500, compared with 50-100 on normal days. The combined use of clustered AERONET, backward trajectories, and PSCF model can help to resolve long-standing issues about source regions and characteristics of pollutants carried to Hong Kong.},

	abstract = {The ESCAPE study (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) investigates long-term effects of exposure to air pollution on human health in Europe. This paper documents the spatial variation of measured NO2 and NOx concentrations between and within 36 ESCAPE study areas across Europe.

In all study areas NO2 and NOx were measured using standardized methods between October 2008 and April 2011. On average, 41 sites were selected per study area, including regional and urban background as well as street sites. The measurements were conducted in three different seasons, using Ogawa badges. Average concentrations for each site were calculated after adjustment for temporal variation using data obtained from a routine monitor background site.

Substantial spatial variability was found in NO2 and NOx concentrations between and within study areas; 40\% of the overall NO2 variance was attributable to the variability between study areas and 60\% to variability within study areas. The corresponding values for NOx were 30\% and 70\%. The within-area spatial variability was mostly determined by differences between street and urban background concentrations. The street/urban background concentration ratio for NO2 varied between 1.09 and 3.16 across areas. The highest median concentrations were observed in Southern Europe, the lowest in Northern Europe.

In conclusion, we found significant contrasts in annual average NO2 and NOx concentrations between and especially within 36 study areas across Europe. Epidemiological long-term studies should therefore consider different approaches for better characterization of the intra-urban contrasts, either by increasing of the number of monitors or by modelling.},

	abstract = {In order to carry out efficient traffic and air quality management, validated models and PM emission estimates are needed. This paper compares current available emission factor estimates for PM10 and PM2.5 from emission databases and different emission models, and validates these against eight high quality street pollution measurements in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Finland and Austria.
The data sets show large variation of the PM concentration and emission factors with season and with location. Consistently at all roads the PM10 and PM2.5 emission factors are lower in the summer month than the rest of the year. For example, PM10 emission factors are in average 5-45\% lower during the month 6-10 compared to the annual average.
The range of observed total emission factors (including non-exhaust emissions) for the different sites during summer conditions are 80-130 mg km-1 for PM10, 30-60 mg km-1 for PM2.5 and 20-50 mg km-1 for the exhaust emissions.
We present two different strategies regarding modelling of PM emissions: (1) For Nordic conditions with strong seasonal variations due to studded tyres and the use of sand/salt as anti-skid treatment a time varying emission model is needed. An empirical model accounting for these Nordic conditions was previously developed in Sweden. (2) For other roads with a less pronounced seasonal variation (e.g. in Denmark, Germany, Austria) methods using a constant emission factor maybe appropriate. Two models are presented here.
Further, we apply the different emission models to data sets outside the original countries. For example, we apply the "Swedish" model for two streets without studded tyre usage and the "German" model for Nordic data sets. The "Swedish" empirical model performs best for streets with studded tyre use, but was not able to improve the correlation versus measurements in comparison to using constant emission factors for the Danish side. The "German" method performed well for the streets without clear seasonal variation and reproduces the summer conditions for streets with pronounced seasonal variation. However, the seasonal variation of PM emission factors can be important even for countries not using studded tyres, e.g. in areas with cold weather and snow events using sand and de-icing materials. Here a constant emission factor probably will under-estimate the 90-percentiles and therefore a time varying emission model need to be used or developed for such areas.
All emission factor models consistently indicate that a large part (about 50-85\% depending on the location) of the total PM10 emissions originates from non-exhaust emissions. This implies that reduction measures for the exhaust part of the vehicle emissions will only have a limited effect on ambient PM10 levels.},

Therefore, investigating the relationship between BC and particle number levels in different particle size ranges at an urban area is worthwhile. This study used an aethalometer and scanning mobility particle sizer to measure the levels of BC and particle number simultaneously at an urban roadside in Taipei City. Measurement results show that hourly BC levels are 0.62–8.80 μg m −3 (mean = 3.50 μg m −3 ) and hourly particle number levels are 4.21 × 10 3 –4.64 × 10 4 particles cm −3 (mean = 2.00 × 10 4 particles cm −3 ) in Taipei urban area. The BC and particle number levels peak during morning (7:00–9:00) and evening (16:00–18:00) rush hours on weekdays. Low BC and particle number levels exist in the early morning hours. Time variations in BC levels are the same as those of particle number levels in this study, clearly indicating that BC and particles are likely released from the same emission source. Additionally, BC levels in the urban area are more strongly associated with ultrafine particle levels than with total particle number levels, particularly in the size range of 56–180 nm. According to measurement results, most BC in aerosols in urban areas can be in the ultrafine size range.},

Standard multiway (tensor) methods like PARAFAC and Tucker tensor decompositions have been applied extensively to many chemical data. However, for multiple particle sizes, the source apportionment analysis calls for a novel multiway factor analysis. We apply the regularized block tensor decomposition to the collected air sample data. In particular, we use the Block Term Decomposition (BTD) in rank-(L;L;1) form to identify nine pollution sources (Fe+Zn, Sulfur with Dust, Road Dust, two types of Metal Works, Road Salt, Local Sulfate, and Homogeneous and Cloud Sulfate).},

	abstract = {This study was undertaken to assess the influence of traffic on particulate air pollution in an urban area, and to characterise the short-range transport of the aerosols generated by traffic. The study was conducted in Kraków, a city located in southern Poland with a population of approximately 800 000. Aerosol samples were collected using automatic sampling equipment at five sites located at different distances from the main road in Kraków, ranging from 5 to 1500 m. The sampling set-up allowed standardisation of the results due to continuous determination of the meteorological parameters (temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall and humidity). Aerosol particles were separated according to aerodynamic diameter into two size fractions: {\textgreater}1.9 [mu]m (coarse fraction); and 1.9-72 [mu]m (fine fraction). The concentrations of 27 elements were measured in both size fractions (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr, Ba, Pb). The multielement analyses were performed by Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) spectrometry. Traffic contribution to particulate air pollution was determined on the basis of 13 elements which were present above the detection limit in all samples (Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb). It was found that the traffic contribution in the coarse size fraction was approximately 80\% up to 150 m from the road; it dropped abruptly by a factor of 2 over a distance of 150-200 m and declined further to 20\% at 1500 m from the road. Traffic contribution for the fine particle concentrations of individual elements was 50-70\% in the close vicinity of the road (5 m); then there was a decrease, followed by an increase at a greater distance from the road. Possible explanations for this behaviour of the fine particles are given.},

Black carbon, a proxy variable for traffic-related air pollution, was measured with an Aethalometer along the predesignated bicycle route in Seattle, Washington, for 10 days, during a.m. and p.m. peak hours (20 sampling campaigns). Descriptive statistics and three-dimensional pollution maps were used to explore temporal variations and to identify pollution hot spots. The LUR model was developed to quantify the influence of spatial covariates on black carbon concentrations along the designated route. The results indicated that the black carbon concentrations fluctuated throughout the sampling periods and showed statistically significant diurnal and monthly patterns. The hot spot analysis suggests that proximity to traffic and other physical environments have important impacts on bicyclists' exposure and demand further investigation on the localized effects of traffic emissions on exposure levels. The LUR model explains 46\% of the variations in black carbon concentrations, and significant relationships are found with types of bicycle route facility, wind speed, length of truck routes, and transportation and utility land uses. This research is the first application of the LUR approach in quantifying bicyclists' exposure to air pollution in transport microenvironments. This study provides a rationale for encouraging municipalities to develop effective strategies to mitigate the health risks of exposure to local traffic emissions in complex urban bicycling environments.},

	abstract = {A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model has been used to assess the concentrations of NOx and particle number in a street canyon in Stockholm with a high traffic volume. Comparisons of a simulated 11-week long time series of NOx with measurements (both sides of the street, urban background excluded) show good agreement, especially if emissions are distributed to be three times higher along the side of the street where the traffic is uphill, as compared to the downhill side. The simulation of number concentrations of inert particles indicates a similar asymmetry in emissions.
A month-long measurement of particle size distribution (7-450 nm) at street level indicates that the ratio of nucleation size mode particle (7-20 nm) to total particle number (7-450 nm) is decreasing for increased particle surface area. Given the strong dominance of the locally generated particles over the urban background, this is interpreted as a local change in the size distribution. The results of a monodisperse aerosol dynamic model, coupled to the CFD model that simulates also the turbulence generated by vehicle movements, show that coagulation and deposition may reduce total particle inside the canyon with approximately 30\% during low wind speeds. Most of the removal occurs shortly after emission, before the particles reach the leeward curb-side. Losses between the leeward curb-side and other locations in the street, e.g. roof levels, is estimated to be smaller, less than 10\%. Coagulation is the dominating removal process under low wind speed conditions and deposition for higher wind speeds, the summed removal being smaller for high wind velocities. Deposition is enhanced over the road surface due to the velocities generated by vehicle movements. Although coagulation and deposition removal is most effective on the smallest ultrafine particles, this effect is not sufficient to explain the observed change in size distribution. It is suggested that also the formation of particles in the exhaust plumes is influenced by a larger particle surface area in the ambient air.},

	abstract = {A measurement campaign by a mobile laboratory van was performed in urban microenvironments bounded by a busy street Mannerheimintie in the city center of Helsinki, Finland. The characteristics of spatiotemporally high-resolution pollutant concentrations were studied such as ultrafine particles in the size range of 3-414 nm, black carbon BC, fine particle mass PM2.5, as well as nitrogen oxides NO and NO2. In addition, the effects of street geometry and roadside structure on the local dispersion of traffic emissions were analysed as well. Meteorological conditions stayed stable and the wind direction was perpendicular to Mannerheimintie during the campaign. The highest particle concentrations were ∼8x105 cm−3, of which around 94\% was smaller than 40 nm. At the pavement, the average concentration was in maximum 5x104 cm−3; around 80\% of the particles was smaller than 40 nm. The volatility fraction was 75\% by number. Due to the street canyon effect by the surrounding buildings, the downwind concentrations were around 24\% of the upwind concentrations for particle number, 28\% of NO, 30\% of BC and 70\% of NO2 concentrations. Furthermore, the upwind concentrations were higher than the simultaneously measured concentrations within the traffic flow. In fact, the particle count was around 3-fold, BC 2.5-fold, PM2.5 and NO2 1.5-fold compared to the concentrations while driving. Thus, for this measurement site and under these meteorological conditions, the exposure to pedestrians and cyclist on the upwind pavement is even higher than the driver’s exposure. If the downwind buildings were parallel to Mannerheimintie, the concentrations dropped significantly at the pavement and continued decreasing slightly in the courtyards. When the downwind buildings were perpendicular to Mannerheimintie, a gradual reduction in the concentrations between the buildings was observed. However, at a distance of approximately a hundred meters a parallel side street which was a street canyon, started to affect the concentrations resulting in an increased exposure risk for pedestrians and cyclists. Understanding the local transport and the dispersion of traffic emissions are important for city planning and air quality assessment.},

	abstract = {A monodispersive aerosol dynamic model, coupled to a 3D hydrodynamical grid model, has been used to study the dynamics of ultrafine particles inside a road tunnel in Stockholm, Sweden. The model results were compared to measured data of particle number concentrations, traffic intensity and tunnel ventilation rate. Coagulation and depositional losses to the tunnel walls were shown to be important processes during traffic peak hours, together contributing to losses of 77\% of the particles smaller than 10 nm and 41\% of the particles of size 10-29 nm. Particle growth due to water uptake or the presence of a micron-sized, resuspended particle fraction did not have any significant effect on the number of particles lost due to coagulation. Model simulation of particle number concentration response to temporal variations in traffic flow showed that constant emission factors could be used to reproduce the concentration variations of the particles larger than 29 nm, while vehicle-speed-dependent factors are suggested to reproduce the variation of the smallest fractions. The emission factors for particle number concentrations estimated from the model simulation are in general higher and show a larger contribution from light-duty vehicles than what has been reported from a tunnel in California. The model study shows that combined measurements and model simulations in road tunnels can be used to improve the determinations of vehicle emission factors for ultrafine particles under realistic driving conditions.},

Specific focus was devoted to secondary particle formation in urban environments resulting from semi volatile precursors emitted by the vehicles. The review discussed temporal and spatial variation in UF particle concentrations, as well as particle chemical composition and relation with gaseous pollutants. Finally, the review attempted to quantify the differences between UF particle concentrations in different environments. These, as well as other aspects of UF characteristics and dynamics in the air, were discussed in the context of human exposure and epidemiological studies as well as in relation to management and control of the particles in vehicle-affected environments.},

	abstract = {An updated assessment of fine particle emissions from light- and heavy-duty vehicles is needed due to recent changes to the composition of gasoline and diesel fuel, more stringent emission standards applying to new vehicles sold in the 1990s, and the adoption of a new ambient air quality standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the United States. This paper reports the measurement of emissions from vehicles in a northern California roadway tunnel during summer 1997. Separate measurements were made of uphill traffic in two tunnel bores: one bore carried both light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty diesel trucks, and the second bore was reserved for light-duty vehicles. Ninety-eight percent of the light-duty vehicles were gasoline-powered. In the tunnel, heavy-duty diesel trucks emitted 24, 37, and 21 times more fine particle, black carbon, and sulfate mass per unit mass of fuel burned than light-duty vehicles. Heavy-duty diesel trucks also emitted 15-20 times the number of particles per unit mass of fuel burned compared to light-duty vehicles. Fine particle emissions from both vehicle classes were composed mostly of carbon; diesel-derived particulate matter contained more black carbon (51±11\% of PM2.5 mass) than did light-duty fine particle emissions (33±4\%). Sulfate comprised only 2\% of total fine particle emissions for both vehicle classes. Sulfate emissions measured in this study for heavy-duty diesel trucks are significantly lower than values reported in earlier studies conducted before the introduction of low-sulfur diesel fuel. This study suggests that heavy-duty diesel vehicles in California are responsible for nearly half of oxides of nitrogen emissions and greater than three-quarters of exhaust fine particle emissions from on-road motor vehicles.},

	abstract = {Fully paraffinic diesel fuel produced from hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVOs) is one alternative to increase the share of renewable energy in the transport sector. HVO fuel has also been shown to reduce exhaust emissions but, as the fuel contains no oxygen, even higher emissions reductions are possible by blending the HVO fuel with suitable oxygenate. From a large number of oxygenates, di-n-pentyl ether (DNPE) was chosen due to its favourable fuel properties (e.g. high cetane number and good solubility to diesel). In this paper, it was studied how fuel blend containing 2 wt.\% oxygen (80 wt.\% HVO and 20 wt.\% DNPE) affects particulate and NOx emissions of a single-cylinder research engine. It was observed that the blend reduced emitted particulate mass 25–30\% depending on load while the NOx emissions was changed under 5\%. Thus, PM and NOx can possibly be both reduced e.g. by utilising EGR. In addition to emission reductions, the effects of the blend on the hygroscopic properties of produced exhaust particles were studied using a hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA). The addition of oxygen into fuel led to a small increase in the hygroscopicity of exhaust particles.},

	abstract = {Exposures to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) can be particularly high in transport microenvironments (i.e. in and around vehicles) despite the short durations typically spent there. There is a mounting body of evidence that suggests that this is especially true for fine (\&lt; 2.5 µm) and ultrafine (\&lt; 100 nm, UF) particles. Professional drivers, who spend extended periods of time in transport microenvironments due to their job, may incur exposures markedly higher than already elevated non-occupational exposures. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown a raised incidence of adverse health outcomes among professional drivers, and exposure to TRAP has been suggested as one of the possible causal factors. Despite this, data describing the range and determinants of occupational exposures to fine and UF particles are largely conspicuous in their absence. Such information could strengthen attempts to define the aetiology of professional drivers' illnesses as it relates to traffic combustion-derived particles. In this article, we suggest that the drivers' occupational fine and UF particle exposures are an exemplar case where opportunities exist to better link exposure science and epidemiology in addressing questions of causality. The nature of the hazard is first introduced, followed by an overview of the health effects attributable to exposures typical of transport microenvironments. Basic determinants of exposure and reduction strategies are also described, and finally the state of knowledge is briefly summarised along with an outline of the main unanswered questions in the topic area.},

Effects of the in-cabin air purifier on particle concentrations and average size inside a vehicle are studied. Use of the air purifier leads to a dramatic reduction, by 95-99\%, in the measured ultrafine particles number concentration inside a vehicle compared with outside readings. Extremely low particle concentrations may be reached without a danger of vehicle occupants' exposure to elevated CO2 levels. The lowest values of particle concentrations inside a PC without air purifier are registered under the recirculation ventilation mode, but the issue of CO2 accumulation limits the use of this mode to very short driving events. Lower PM concentrations are found inside newer cars, if this ventilation mode is used. Great differences by a factor of 2.5-3 in PM10 concentrations are found between the PCs and the buses. Smoking inside a car leads to a dramatic increase, by approximately 90 times, in PM2.5 concentrations.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in office environments are generally too low to cause sensory irritation in the eyes and airways on the basis of estimated thresholds for sensory irritation. Furthermore, effects in the lungs, e.g. inflammatory effects, have not been substantiated at indoor relevant concentrations. Some VOCs, including formaldehyde, in combination may under certain environmental and occupational conditions result in reported sensory irritation. The odour thresholds of several VOCs are low enough to influence the perceived air quality that result in a number of acute effects from reported sensory irritation in eyes and airways and deterioration of performance. The odour perception (air quality) depends on a number of factors that may influence the odour impact. There is neither clear indication that office dust particles may cause sensory effects, even not particles spiked with glucans, aldehydes or phthalates, nor lung effects; some inflammatory effects may be observed among asthmatics. Ozone-initiated terpene reaction products may be of concern in ozone-enriched environments (≥0.1 mg/m3) and elevated limonene concentrations, partly due to the production of formaldehyde. Ambient particles may cause cardio-pulmonary effects, especially in susceptible people (e.g. elderly and sick people); even, short-term effects, e.g. from traffic emission and candle smoke may possibly have modulating and delayed effects on the heart, but otherwise adverse effects in the airways and lung functions have not been observed. Secondary organic aerosols generated in indoor ozone-initiated terpene reactions appear not to cause adverse effects in the airways; rather the gaseous products are relevant. Combined exposure to particles and ozone may evoke effects in subgroups of asthmatics.

Based on an analysis of thresholds for odour and sensory irritation selected compounds are recommended for measurements to assess the indoor air quality and to minimize reports of irritation symptoms, deteriorated performance, and cardiovascular and pulmonary effects.},

Particle sensing is based on the detection of the forward scattering of laser light. The separation of the laser beam and scattered light is achieved with a novel yet simple optical system. A laboratory prototype system with a 405-nm laser and photomultiplier tube detector has successfully detected polystyrene latex particles as small as 125 nm in diameter with unit efficiency. Theoretical calculations suggest that a lower detectable size limit of 100 nm can be achieved with reduction of background scattered light.

This paper analyses the spatial variation of PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, PM10 and PMcoarse concentrations between and within 20 study areas across Europe.

We measured NO2, NOX, PM2.5, PM2.5absorbance and PM10 between October 2008 and April 2011 using standardized methods. PMcoarse was determined as the difference between PM10 and PM2.5. In each of the twenty study areas, we selected twenty PM monitoring sites to represent the variability in important air quality predictors, including population density, traffic intensity and altitude. Each site was monitored over three 14-day periods spread over a year, using Harvard impactors. Results for each site were averaged after correcting for temporal variation using data obtained from a reference site, which was operated year-round.

Substantial concentration differences were observed between and within study areas. Concentrations for all components were higher in Southern Europe than in Western and Northern Europe, but the pattern differed per component with the highest average PM2.5 concentrations found in Turin and the highest PMcoarse in Heraklion. Street/urban background concentration ratios for PMcoarse (mean ratio 1.42) were as large as for PM2.5absorbance (mean ratio 1.38) and higher than those for PM2.5 (1.14) and PM10 (1.23), documenting the importance of non-tailpipe emissions. Correlations between components varied between areas, but were generally high between NO2 and PM2.5absorbance (average R2=0.80). Correlations between PM2.5 and PMcoarse were lower (average R2=0.39). Despite high correlations, concentration ratios between components varied, e.g. the NO2/PM2.5 ratio varied between 0.67 and 3.06.

In conclusion, substantial variability was found in spatial patterns of PM2.5, PM2.5absorbance, PM10 and PMcoarse. The highly standardized measurement of particle concentrations across Europe will contribute to a consistent assessment of health effects across Europe.},

Aromatic VOCs are of special great concern due to their adverse health effects. Measurements of benzene, toluene and xylenes were carried out in central Copenhagen since 1994. Significant correlation was observed between VOCs and CO concentrations, indicating that the petrol engine vehicles are the major sources of VOC air pollution in central Copenhagen. Hourly mean concentrations of benzene were observed to reach values of up to 20 ppb, what is critically high according to the WHOs recommendations. Based on inverse model calculation of dispersion of pollutants in street canyons, an average emission factor of benzene for the fleet of petrol fuelled vehicles was estimated to be 0.38 g/km in 1994 and 0.11 in 1997. This decrease was caused by the reduction of benzene content in Danish petrol since summer 1995 and increasing percentage of cars equipped with three-way catalysts. The emission factors for benzene for diesel-fuelled vehicles were low.},

Weather conditions were found to have strong impact on the area’s air quality. Between two flights on April 10 and 11, the SO2 loading increased by an order of magnitude within 24 hr, from ∼0.1 DU (Dobson Unit) to ∼1 DU. Meteorological observations and back trajectory analyses suggest that anthropogenic pollutants emitted from the area accumulated under stagnant conditions induced by a mid-latitude cyclone approaching from the west. The observed rapid buildup demonstrates that strong local emissions can expose the populace to high pollutant levels under unfavorable weather conditions. Ångström exponents determined from the aircraft and ground-based sun photometers are significantly smaller over China than over the U.S., suggesting the prevalence of dust particles in northern China, particularly in spring. The coarse mode became more pronounced with altitude, indicating dust-dominant aerosol layers in the lower free troposphere, which shouldbe accounted for in the satellite remote sensing of surface pollution over the region. Information on the vertical distribution of aerosols and precursor gases over China will also help better understand their transport as well as effects on weather and climate.},

This review begins with a historical perspective on the scientific questions regarding atmospheric aerosols over the past centuries, followed by a description of the distribution, sources, transformation processes, and chemical and physical properties as they are currently understood. The major open questions and suggestions for future research priorities are outlined to narrow the gap between the present understanding of the contribution of both anthropogenic and biogenic aerosols to radiative forcing resulting from the spatial non-uniformity, intermittency of sources, unresolved composition and reactivity.},

	abstract = {The number size distributions of aerosol particles were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) at a mid-latitude forest in Japan during 20–30 August 2010. Four days during the observation period experienced new particle formation (NPF) under the conditions of low condensation and coagulation sinks. The formation rate of new particles was calculated to be in the range between 0.2 and 1.0 cm−3 s−1 for the NPF events. The growth rates of the newly formed mode of aerosol particles ranged between 5.0 and 15.7 nm h−1. The backward air mass trajectories revealed that the NPF occurred in clean maritime air masses originated from the North Pacific, which is characterized with the low mass concentrations of aerosol components. The results from the classification analysis of backward air mass trajectories indicate that the maritime air mass conditions are frequent at this forest site and are primarily in summer season. Large increases in the number concentrations of accumulation mode particles (above 90 nm) were followed by the increased precipitation rates in the afternoon hours on the NPF event days. Therefore, the newly-formed particles would be involved in the convective cloud formation and precipitation over the studied region.},

Filter samples were analyzed for elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) content by using a thermo-optical transmittance method. The light-absorbing carbon (LAC) content was determined by employing a commercial Aethalometer and a custom-built particle soot absorption photometer. Filter samples were used to convert the optical signals to LAC mass concentrations. Additional total PM10 mass concentrations and meteorological parameters were measured. The mean and standard deviation mass concentrations were 4.4±3.6 [mu]g m-3 for OC, and 1.4±1.2 [mu]g m-3 for EC. On average, EC accounted for 10.7\% of the total PM10 and the contribution of OC to the total PM10 was 35.4\%. Aethalometer and custom-built PSAP measurements were highly correlated (R2=0.92). The hourly mean value of LAC mass concentration was 1.76 [mu]g m-3 (median 0.88 [mu]g m-3) for the winter 2005-2006. This study shows that the custom-built PSAP is a reliable alternative for the commercial Aethalometer with the advantage of being a low-cost instrument.},

	abstract = {Air quality measurements were made on interstate highways in the Minneapolis metropolitan area. Gas and aerosol concentrations were measured on weekdays and weekends. By exploiting the difference in the relative volumes of heavy duty (HD) diesel and light duty (LD) spark ignition (SI) vehicles on weekdays and weekends, we were able to estimate apportioned fuel specific emissions.
The on-road, apportioned, fuel specific particle number emissions factors, estimated from condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements were 1.34±0.2×1016 particles kg-1 for diesels and 7.1±1.6×1015 particles kg-1 for spark ignition vehicles. Estimates from the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) measurements were 2.1±0.3×1015 particles kg-1 for diesels and 3.9±0.6×1014 particles kg-1 for SI vehicles. The difference between CPC and SMPS measurements is mainly due to different lower size detection limits of the instruments, {\textasciitilde}3 and {\textasciitilde}10 nm, respectively.
On a weekly weighted basis and on weekdays, the majority of particle number was attributed to HD diesel traffic. Weekend production of particles can be primarily attributed to light duty SI automobiles. On a per vehicle basis, HD vehicles produced substantially greater numbers of particles. On a fuel specific basis, HD vehicles produce slightly higher concentrations of particles than light duty vehicles. The relative contribution of LD vehicles to particle number emissions increased as particle size decreased.
The HD apportioned size distributions were similar to size distributions measured during other on-road and laboratory studies. The LD apportioned size distribution was bounded by laboratory and on-road size distributions. Our work is representative of summer, highway cruise conditions. It is likely that under cold start and high load operating conditions LD emissions will increase relative to HD emissions.},

The emission factor of biodiesel EC is 90.6 mg/kW h, which decreases by 60.3 and 71.7\%, compared with ULSD and LSD respectively and the mass mean diameter (MMD) of EC was also decreased with the use of biodiesel. The effect of biodiesel on OC emission might depend on the engine operation condition, and the difference in OC size distribution is not that significant among the three fuels. For biodiesel, its brake specific emission of particle-phase PAHs is obviously smaller than that from the two diesel fuels, and the reduction effect appears in almost all size ranges. In terms of size distribution, the MMD of PAHs from biodiesel is larger than that from the two diesel fuels, which could be attributed to the more effective reduction on combustion derived PAHs in nuclei mode. The toxicity analysis indicates that biodiesel could reduce the total PAHs emissions, as well as the carcinogenic potency of particle-phase PAHs in almost all the size ranges.},

The reduced set of variables including these derived variables is therefore proposed as optimal variable set for training neural networks models in forecasting geophysical and weather properties.

A new multi-channel Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) CO data product, offering improved sensitivity to the boundary later, is used, to estimate this relative change over eight megacities: Moscow, Paris, Mexico, Tehran, Baghdad, Los Angeles, Sao Paulo and Delhi. By combining MOPITT observations with wind information from a meteorological reanalysis, changes in the CO upwind-downwind difference are used as a proxy for changes in emissions. Most locations show a clear reduction of CO emission between 2000-2003 and 2004-2008, reaching -43\% over Tehran and -47\% over Baghdad.

We consider the entire emission-climate response spectrum and present a set of experiments using the coupled climate model NorESM. A new emission dataset including BC emissions from flaring and a seasonal variation in the domestic sector has been used. The climate model includes a snow model, SNICAR, to simulate the climate effect of BC deposited on snow. We find that BC emitted within the Arctic has an almost 5-times larger Arctic surface temperature response (per unit of emitted mass) compared to emissions at mid-latitudes. Especially during winter, BC emitted in North-Eurasia is transported into the high Arctic at low altitudes. A large fraction of the surface temperature response from BC is due to increased absorption when BC is deposited on snow and sea-ice with associated feedbacks. Today there are few within-Arctic sources of BC, but the emissions are expected to grow due to increased human activity in the Arctic. There is a great need to improve cleaner technologies if further development is to take place in the Arctic, especially since the Arctic has a significantly higher sensitivity to BC emitted within the Arctic compared to BC emitted at mid-latitudes.},

Emissions from four trucks: one equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and three equipped with EGR and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device were measured on two different routes with three different payloads using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) in the Sacramento area. Results indicated that brake-specific NOx emissions for the truck equipped only with an EGR were independent of the driving conditions. Results also showed that for typical highway driving conditions, the SCR technology is proving to be effective in controlling NOx emissions. However, under operations where the SCR?s do not reach minimum operating temperature, like cold starts and some low load/slow speed driving conditions, NOx emissions are still elevated. The study indicated that strategies used to maintain exhaust temperature above a certain threshold, which are used in some of the newer SCRs, have the potential to control NOx emissions during certain low-load/slow speed driving conditions.},

	abstract = {Ice core measurements in conjunction with climate model simulations are of tremendous value when examining anthropogenic and natural aerosol loads and their role in past and future climates. Refractory black carbon (BC) records from the Arctic, the Antarctic, and the Himalayas are analyzed using three transient climate simulations performed with the GISS ModelE. Simulations differ in aerosol schemes (bulk aerosols vs. aerosol microphysics) and ocean couplings (fully coupled vs. prescribed ocean). Regional analyses for past (1850–2005) and future (2005–2100) carbonaceous aerosol simulations focus on the Antarctic, Greenland, and the Himalayas. Measurements from locations in the Antarctic show clean conditions with no detectable trend over the past 150 years. Historical atmospheric deposition of BC and sulfur in Greenland show strong trends and are primarily influenced by emissions from early 20th century agricultural and domestic practices. Models fail to reproduce observations of a sharp 8-fold BC increase in Greenland at the beginning of the 20th century that could be due to the only 3-fold increase in the North American emission inventory. BC deposition in Greenland is about 10 times greater than in Antarctica and 10 times less than in Tibet. The Himalayas show the most complicated transport patterns, due to the complex terrain and dynamical regimes of this region. Projections of future climate based on the four CMIP5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) indicate further dramatic advances of pollution to the Tibetan plateau along with decreasing BC deposition fluxes in Greenland and the Antarctic.},

The simulations include a maximum feasible aerosol reduction (MFR) scenario, a CLEmod scenario where Europe implements the MFR scenario, but the rest of the world follows the current legislation scenario and a greenhouse gas scenario following SRES B2. Strongest changes relative to the year 2000 are projected for the MFR scenario in which the global aerosol reduction greatly enforces the general warming effect due to greenhouse gases and results in significant increases of temperature and precipitation extremes in Europe. Regional warming effects can also be identified from aerosol reductions under the CLEmod scenario. This becomes most obvious in the increase of the hottest summer day-time temperatures in Northern Europe.},

	abstract = {Reactions between ozone and terpenoids produce numerous products, some of which may form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This work investigated the contribution to gas-phase SOA formation of ozone reactions with surface-sorbed d-limonene, which is common indoors. A model framework was developed to predict SOA mass formation because of ozone/terpenoid surface reactions, and it was used with steady state experiments in a 283 L chamber to determine the aerosol mass fraction of SOA resulting from surface reactions, ?s (the ratio of mass of SOA formed and mass of ozone consumed by ozone/terpenoid surface reactions), for ozone/d-limonene reactions on stainless steel. The ?s = 0.70?0.91, with lower relative humidity leading to both higher mass and number formation. Also, surface reactions promoted nucleation more than gas-phase reactions, and number formation due to surface reactions and gas-phase reactions were 126?339 and 51.1?60.2 no./cm3 per ?g/m3 of formed SOA, respectively. We also used the model framework to predict that indoor spaces in which ozone/d-limonene surface reactions would likely lead to meaningful gas-phase SOA formation are those with surfaces that have low original reactivity with ozone, such as glass, sealed materials, or smooth metals.},

The purpose of this study was to calibrate and evaluate an existing, polystyrene?divinylbenzene copolymeric resin-based passive air sampler (XAD-PAS) for VMS. Sixteen XAD-PAS were deployed for 7?98 days at a suburban site in Toronto, Canada, while the VMS concentration in air was monitored by an active sampling method. This calibration and a subsequent field test further allowed for investigation of the temporal and spatial variability of VMS in the region. Uptake in the XAD-PAS of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5), and three linear VMS was linear throughout the whole deployment period. Sampling rates were between 0.4 and 0.5 m3/day. The XAD-PAS measured ?VMS concentrations ranged from nondetects in rural areas (n = 3), to 169 ± 49 ng/m3 in the urban region (n = 21), to levels above 600 ng/m3 at sewage treatment plants (n = 2). Levels and composition of VMS within the urban area were remarkably uniform in space. Levels, but not composition, were highly variable in time and weakly correlated with temperature, wind speed, and wind direction.},

Because nuclear power is an abundant, low-carbon source of base-load power, it could make a large contribution to mitigation of global climate change and air pollution. Using historical production data, we calculate that global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning. On the basis of global projection data that take into account the effects of the Fukushima accident, we find that nuclear power could additionally prevent an average of 420?000?7.04 million deaths and 80?240 GtCO2-eq emissions due to fossil fuels by midcentury, depending on which fuel it replaces. By contrast, we assess that large-scale expansion of unconstrained natural gas use would not mitigate the climate problem and would cause far more deaths than expansion of nuclear power.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
Three years of aerosol measurements from four European cities were analysed to identify and quantify the parameters influencing the particle number size distribution (NSD) at different measurement sites (Copenhagen, Helsinki, Leipzig, London). A ‘triple-site’ approach was established with data from a roadside, an urban background and a rural measurement station, which was available for each city. The NSD measurements were conducted over a diameter size range of 8 to 700 nm. 
 
The average annual total number concentrations varied between 1,700 cm-3 (Finnish rural site) and 23,000 particles cm-³ (London roadside). Highest variability on the diurnal course was found for the roadside sites and on the seasonal course for the rural sites. A first identification of the influencing parameters was found using correlation analysis. The most dominating factors were then quantified using a multiple linear regression approach documenting the highest influence for daytime (45 \%) followed by wind direction (18 \%), season (12 \%), wind speed (11 \%), temperature (8 \%) and solar radiation (6 \%), on average. The variation of influence between the different cities is analysed and discussed. Subsequently NSDs were modelled using the regression approach in order to verify how well the parameters are capable of ‘explaining’ the actual NSD, showing best performance for roadside NSD with correlation coefficients between 0.65 and 0.8 and limited performance for the rural sites (0.5 to 0.6).},

	abstract = {A great deal of uncertainty exists regarding the chemical diversity of particles in sea spray aerosol (SSA), as well as the degree of mixing between inorganic and organic species in individual SSA particles. Therefore, in this study, single particle analysis was performed on SSA particles, integrating transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, with a focus on quantifying the relative fractions of different particle types from 30 nm to 1 ?m. SSA particles were produced from seawater in a unique ocean-atmosphere facility equipped with breaking waves. Changes to the SSA composition and properties after the addition of biological (bacteria and phytoplankton) and organic material (ZoBell growth media) were probed. Submicrometer SSA particles could be separated into two distinct populations: one with a characteristic sea salt core composed primarily of NaCl and an organic carbon and Mg2+ coating (SS-OC), and a second type consisting of organic carbon (OC) species which are more homogeneously mixed with cations and anions, but not chloride. SS-OC particles exhibit a wide range of sizes, compositions, morphologies, and distributions of elements within each particle. After addition of biological and organic material to the seawater, a change occurs in particle morphology and crystallization behavior associated with increasing organic content for SS-OC particles. The fraction of OC-type particles, which are mainly present below 180 nm, becomes dramatically enhanced with increased biological activity. These changes with size and seawater composition have important implications for atmospheric processes such as cloud droplet activation and heterogeneous reactivity.},

Good models were developed for Cu, Fe, and Zn in both fractions (PM10 and PM2.5) explaining on average between 67 and 79\% of the concentration variance (R2) with a large variability between areas. Traffic variables were the dominant predictors, reflecting nontailpipe emissions. Models for V and S in the PM10 and PM2.5 fractions and Si, Ni, and K in the PM10 fraction performed moderately with R2 ranging from 50 to 61\%.

The obtained cloud optical properties were then applied to an interactive system by coupling an aerosol model with a General Circulation Model. This system is used to investigate the radiative forcing and the equilibrium climate response due to BC in cloud droplets. The simulated global annual mean radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere due to the BC in cloud droplets is found to be 0.086 W m−2. Positive radiative forcing can be seen in Africa, South America, East and South Asia, and West Europe, with a maximum value of 1.5 W m−2 being observed in these regions. The enhanced cloud absorption is shown to increase the global annual mean values of solar heating rate, water vapor, and temperature, but to decrease the global annual mean cloud fraction. Finally, the global annual mean surface temperature is shown to increase by +0.08 K. The local maximum changes are found to be as low as −1.5 K and as high as +0.6 K. We show there has been a significant difference in surface temperature change in the Southern and Northern Hemisphere (+0.19 K and −0.04 K, respectively). Our results show that this interhemispheric asymmetry in surface temperature change could cause a corresponding change in atmospheric dynamics and precipitation. It is also found that the northern trade winds are enhanced in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This results in northerly surface wind anomalies which cross the equator to converge with the enhanced southern trade winds in the tropics of Southern Hemisphere. This is shown to lead to an increase (a decrease) of vertical ascending motion and precipitation on the south (north) side of the equator, which could induce a southward shift in the tropical rainfall maximum related to the ITCZ.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
A better understanding of ultrafine particle (UFP) exposure in different urban transport microenvironments is important for epidemiological exposure assessments and for policy making. 
 
Three sub-studies were performed to characterize personal exposure to UFP concentration and average particle size distribution diameters in frequently traveled commuter microenvironments in the city of Basel, Switzerland. First, the spatial variation of sidewalk UFP exposures within urban areas and transport-specific microenvironments was explored. Second, exposure to UFP concentration and average particle size were quantified for five modes of transportation (walking, bicycle, bus, tram, car) during different times of the day and week, along the same route. Finally, the contribution of bicycle commuting along two different routes (along main roads, away from main roads) to total daily exposures was assessed by 24-hour personal measurements. 
 
In general, smaller average particle sizes and higher UFP levels were measured at places and for travel modes in close proximity to traffic. Average trip UFP concentrations were higher in car (31,784 particles/cm³) and on bicycle (22,660 particles/cm³) compared to walking (19,481 particles/cm³) and public transportation (14,055-18,818 particles/cm³). Concentrations were highest for all travel modes during weekday morning rush hours, compared to other time periods. UFP concentration was lowest in bus, regardless of time period. Bicycle travel along main streets between home and work place (24 minutes on average) contributed 21\% and 5\% to total daily UFP exposure in winter and summer, respectively. Contribution of bicycle commutes to total daily UFP exposure could be reduced by half if main roads are avoided 
 
Our results show the importance of considering commuter behavior and route choice in exposure assessment studies.},

	abstract = {Using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's (GFDL's) fully coupled chemistry-climate (ocean/atmosphere/land/sea ice) model (CM3) with an explicit physical representation of aerosol indirect effects (cloud-water droplet activation), we find that the dramatic emission reductions (35\%–80\%) in anthropogenic aerosols and their precursors projected by Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 result in 1 °C of additional warming and 0.1 mm day−1 of additional precipitation, both globally averaged, by the end of the 21st century. The impact of these reductions in aerosol emissions on simulated global mean surface temperature and precipitation becomes apparent by mid-21st century. Furthermore, we find that the aerosol emission reductions cause precipitation to increase in East and South Asia by 1.0 mm day−1 through the second half of the 21st century. Both the temperature and the precipitation responses simulated by CM3 are significantly stronger than the responses previously simulated by our earlier climate model (CM2.1) that only considered direct radiative forcing by aerosols. We conclude that the indirect effects of sulfate aerosol greatly enhance the impacts of aerosols on surface temperature in CM3; both direct and indirect effects from sulfate aerosols dominate the strong precipitation response, possibly with a small contribution from carbonaceous aerosols. Just as we found with the previous GFDL model, CM3 produces surface warming patterns that are uncorrelated with the spatial distribution of 21st century changes in aerosol loading. However, the largest precipitation increases in CM3 are colocated with the region of greatest aerosol decrease, in and downwind of Asia.},

We developed a simple model to calculate the regional deposited dose of submicron aerosol particles in the respiratory system. This model incorporates measured outdoor and modeled indoor particle number size distributions, detailed activity patterns of three age groups (teens, adults, and the elderly), semi-empirical estimation of the regional deposition fraction, hygroscopic properties of urban aerosols, and reported breathing minute volumes. We calculated the total and regional deposited dose based on three concentration metrics: particle number (PN), mass (PM), and surface area (PSA). The 24-h total deposited dose of fine particles in adult males was around 40 μg (57 × 109 particles, 8 × 102 mm2) and 41 μg (40 × 109 particles, 8 × 102 mm2) on workdays and weekends, respectively. The total and regional 24-h deposited dose based on any of the metrics was at most 1.5 times higher in males than in females. The deposited dose values in the other age groups were slightly different than in adults. Regardless of the particle size fraction or the deposited dose metric, the pulmonary/alveolar region received the largest fraction of the deposited dose. These values represent the lowest estimate of the deposited dose and they are expected to be higher in real-life conditions after considering indoor sources of aerosol particles and spatial variability of outdoor aerosols. This model can be extended to youngsters (\&lt; 12 years old) after gaining accurate information about the deposition fraction inside their respiratory system and their breathing pattern. This investigation is foreseen to bridge the gap between exposure and response in epidemiological studies.},

Measurements took place at roads with representative traffic regimes:? at the kerbside of a motorway (120 km h-1), a highway (80?100 km h-1), and in an urban area with stop-and-go traffic (0?50 km h-1) regulated by light signals. Mean diurnal variations showed that the highest pollutant concentrations were during the morning rush hours, especially of the number density in the nanoparticle size range (D {\textless} 50 nm). From the differences between up- and downwind concentrations (or differences between kerbside and background concentrations for the urban site), ?real-life? emission factors were derived using NOx concentrations to calculate dilution factors. Particle number and volume emission factors of different size ranges (18?50 nm, 18?100 nm, and 18?300 nm) were derived for the total vehicle fleet and separated into a light-duty (LDV) and a heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) contribution. The total particle number emissions per vehicle were found to be about 11.7?13.5 ? 1014 particles km-1 for constant speed (80?120 km h-1) and 3.9 ? 1014 particles km-1 for urban driving conditions. LDVs showed higher emission factors at constant high speed than under urban disturbed traffic flow. In contrast, HDVs emitted more air pollutants during deceleration and acceleration processes in stop-and-go traffic than with constant speed of about 80 km h-1. On average, one HDV emits a 10?30 times higher amount of particulate air pollutants (in terms of both number and volume) than one LDV.},

We conducted measurements in three different environments, on-road, roadside and ambient. The carbon monoxide, black carbon and ultrafine particle number emission factors for on-road light-duty vehicles are derived to be 95 g kg−1-fuel, 0.3 g kg−1-fuel and 1.8 × 1015 particles kg−1-fuel, respectively. The emission factors for on-road heavy-duty vehicles are 50 g kg−1-fuel, 1.3 g kg−1-fuel and 1.1 × 1016 particles kg−1-fuel, respectively. The carbon monoxide emission factors from this study agree with those derived from remote sensing and on-board vehicle emission testing systems in China. The on-road black carbon and particle number emission factors for Chinese vehicles are reported for the first time in the literature. Strong traffic impacts can be observed from the concentrations measured in these different environments. Most clear is a reflection of diesel truck traffic activity in black carbon concentrations. The comparison of the particle size distributions measured at the three environments suggests that the traffic is a major source of ultrafine particles. A four-day traffic control experiment conducted by the Beijing Government as a pilot to test the effectiveness of proposed controls was found to be effective in reducing extreme concentrations that occurred at both on-road and ambient environments.},

Black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particle number size distribution were measured near a major urban expressway of Beijing during summer and winter field campaigns in 2009. BC was also observed at urban and rural sites. The temporal variations of BC and its relationships with CO and particle number size distribution were analyzed. The average BC concentrations at the roadside site were 12.3 and 17.9 μg m-3 during the summer and winter campaigns, respectively. BC concentrations ranked in the order of roadside \&gt; urban \&gt; rural. A general diurnal pattern at all sites showed that the higher BC levels were observed at night. The diurnal pattern of summertime BC at the roadside site followed the variations of heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs). The increased proportion of HDDVs at night contributed to high ΔBC/ΔCO ratios. This study suggests that HDDVs are an important contributor to nighttime BC and particle number concentrations of both Aitken and accumulation modes near major roadways in Beijing, especially in summer.},

Exposure to traffic-related air pollution has been linked to increased risks of cardiopulmonary disease, asthma, and reduced lung function. Ultrafine particles (UFP; aerodynamic diameter \&lt; 100 nm), one component of traffic exhaust, may contribute to these risks. This paper describes the development of UFP emission factors, an important input parameter for dispersion models used for exposure assessment. Measurements of particle number concentration (PNC), a proxy for UFP, were performed in the Central Artery Tunnel on Interstate-93 in Boston (MA, USA). The tunnel system consists of two, unidirectional bores, which each carry ∼9 × 104 vehicles per day (diesel vehicles comprise 2–5\% of the fleet in the southbound tunnel and 1–3\% in the northbound tunnel). A tunnel was chosen for study because it provided an enclosed environment where the effects of lateral and vertical dispersion by ambient air and photochemical reactions would be minimized. Data were collected using a mobile platform equipped with rapid-response instruments for measuring PNC (4–3000 nm) as well as NOx. Because Boston is located in a temperate region (latitude 42° N), we were interested in studying seasonal and diurnal differences in emission factors. To characterize seasonal differences, mobile monitoring was performed on 36 days spaced at 7–14 day intervals over one year (Sept. 2010–Sept. 2011); to characterize diurnal differences intensive mobile monitoring (n = 90 total trips through the tunnels) was performed over the course of two consecutive days in January 2012. All data collected during congested traffic conditions (∼7\% of total data set) were removed from the analysis. The median PNC inside the two tunnels for all trips during the 12-month campaign was 3–4-fold higher than on I-93 immediately outside the tunnel and 7–10-fold higher than on I-93 4 km from the tunnel. The median particle number emission factors (EFPN) (±median absolute deviation) for the southbound and northbound tunnels were 5.1 × 1014 (2.3 × 1014) and 1.4 × 1014 (4.2 × 1013) particles vehicle−1 km−1, respectively. EFPN values were ∼2-fold higher in winter and spring (average ambient temperature at the time of monitoring = 6.9 °C) compared to summer and fall (12.9 °C), and ∼2-fold higher in the morning (−7.9 °C) compared to the afternoon/evening (−0.9 °C) on two consecutive winter days. Our results suggest that seasonal and diurnal variations in particulate emissions from highway vehicles may be important to consider in developing EFPN values.},

	abstract = {It has not yet been established whether the spatial variation of particle number concentration (PNC) within a microscale environment can have an effect on exposure estimation results. In general, the degree of spatial variation within microscale environments remains unclear, since previous studies have only focused on spatial variation within macroscale environments. The aims of this study were to determine the spatial variation of PNC within microscale school environments, in order to assess the importance of the number of monitoring sites on exposure estimation. Furthermore, this paper aims to identify which parameters have the largest influence on spatial variation as well as the relationship between those parameters and spatial variation. Air quality measurements were conducted for two consecutive weeks at each of the 25 schools across Brisbane, Australia. PNC was measured at three sites within the grounds of each school, along with the measurement of meteorological and several other air quality parameters. Traffic density was recorded for the busiest road adjacent to the school. Spatial variation at each school was quantified using coefficient of variation (CV). The portion of CV associated with instrument uncertainty was found to be 0.3, and, therefore, CV was corrected so that only noninstrument uncertainty was analyzed in the data. The median corrected CV (CVc) ranged from 0 to 0.35 across the schools, with 12 schools found to exhibit spatial variation. The study determined the number of required monitoring sites at schools with spatial variability and tested the deviation in exposure estimation arising from using only a single site. Nine schools required two measurement sites and three schools required three sites. Overall, the deviation in exposure estimation from using only one monitoring site was as much as 1 order of magnitude. The study also tested the association of spatial variation with wind speed/direction and traffic density, using partial correlation coefficients to identify sources of variation and nonparametric function estimation to quantify the level of variability. Traffic density and road to school wind direction were found to have a positive effect on CVc and, therefore, also on spatial variation. Wind speed was found to have a decreasing effect on spatial variation when it exceeded a threshold of 1.5 (m/s), while it had no effect below this threshold. Traffic density had a positive effect on spatial variation and its effect increased until it reached a density of 70 vehicles per five minutes, at which point its effect plateaued and did not increase further as a result of increasing traffic density.},

The SW fuels burned at a higher Modified Combustion Efficiency (MCE) than the SE fuels resulting in lower particulate matter (PM) mass emission factor (EF). Particle mass distributions for six fuels and particle number emission for all fuels are reported. Excellent mass closure (slope = 1.00, r2 = 0.94) between ions, metals, and carbon with total weight was obtained. Organic carbon emission factors inversely correlated (R2= 0.72) with average MCE, while elemental carbon (EC) had little correlation with average MCE (R2=0.10). The EC/total carbon (TC) ratio sharply increased with MCE for MCEs exceeding 0.94. The average levoglucosan and total polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions factors ranged from 25–1272 mg/kg fuel and 1.8-11.3 mg/kg fuel, respectively. No correlation between average MCE and emissions of PAHs/levoglucosan was found. Additionally, PAH diagnostic ratios were observed to be poor indicators of biomass burning. Large fuel-type and regional dependency was observed in the emission rates of ammonium, nitrate, chloride, sodium, and potassium.},

The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model is used to provide prior information for the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieval and to relate total column AOD to PM2.5. We adjust the shape of the GEOS-Chem relative vertical extinction profiles by comparison with lidar retrievals from the CALIOP satellite instrument. Surface reflectance relationships used in the OE algorithm are indexed by land type. Error quantities needed for this OE algorithm are inferred by comparison with AOD observations taken by a worldwide network of sunphotometers (AERONET) and extended globally based upon aerosol speciation and cross correlation for simulated values, and upon land type for observational values. Significant agreement in PM2.5is found over North America for 2005 (slope = 0.89; r = 0.82; 1-σ error = 1 μg/m3 + 27\%), with improved coverage and correlation relative to previous work for the same region and time period, although certain subregions, such as the San Joaquin Valley of California are better represented by previous estimates. Independently-derived error estimates of the OEPM2.5 values at in-situ locations over North America (±(2.5 μg/m3 + 31\%)) and Europe (±(3.5 μg/m3 + 30\%)) are corroborated by comparison with in-situ observations, although globally (±(3.0 μg/m3 + 35\%)) these errors may be underestimated.

Limited studies assessing integrated daily residential exposure to just one particle size fraction, ultrafine particles, show that the contribution of indoor sources ranged from 19-76\%. This indicates a strong dependence on resident activities, source events and site specificity, and highlights the importance of indoor sources for total personal exposure. Further, it was assessed that 10-30\% of the total burden-of-disease from particulate matter exposure was due to indoor generated particles, signifying that indoor environments are likely to be a dominant environmental factor affecting human health. However, due to challenges associated with conducting epidemiological assessments, the role of indoor generated particles has not been fully acknowledged, and improved exposure/risk assessment methods are still needed, together with a serious focus on exposure control.© 2013 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.

	abstract = {An on-road sampling campaign was conducted on two major surface streets (Wilshire and Sunset Boulevards) in Los Angeles, CA, to characterize PM components including metals, trace elements, and organic species for three PM size fractions (PM10–2.5, PM2.5–0.25, and PM0.25). Fuel-based emission factors (mass of pollutant per kg of fuel) were calculated to assess the emissions profile of a light-duty vehicle (LDV) traffic fleet characterized by stop-and-go driving conditions that are reflective of urban street driving. Emission factors for metals and trace elements were highest in PM10–2.5 while emission factors for PAHs and hopanes and steranes were highest in PM0.25. PM2.5 emission factors were also compared to previous freeway, roadway tunnel, and dynamometer studies based on an LDV fleet to determine how various environments and driving conditions may influence concentrations of PM components. The on-road sampling methodology deployed in the current study captured substantially higher levels of metals and trace elements associated with vehicular abrasion (Fe, Ca, Cu, and Ba) and crustal origins (Mg and Al) than previous LDV studies. The semi-volatile nature of PAHs resulted in higher levels of PAHs in the particulate phase for LDV tunnel studies (Phuleria et al., 2006) and lower levels of PAHs in the particulate phase for freeway studies (Ning et al., 2008). With the exception of a few high molecular weight PAHs, the current study's emission factors were in between the LDV tunnel and LDV freeway studies. In contrast, hopane and sterane emission factors were generally comparable between the current study, the LDV tunnel, and LDV freeway, as expected given the greater atmospheric stability of these organic compounds. Overall, the emission factors from the dynamometer studies for metals, trace elements, and organic species are lower than the current study. Lastly, n-alkanes (C19–C40) were quantified and alkane carbon preference indices (CPIs) were determined to be in the range of 1–2, indicating substantial anthropogenic source contribution for surface streets in Los Angeles.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and black carbon (BC) emission factors (EF) of 440 on-road diesel trucks were determined by conducting on-road chasing studies in Beijing and Chongqing, China, in the winter 2010. NOx and BC EF distributions are reported. The median NOx EFs for trucks sampled on level roads in Chongqing and Beijing are 40.0 and 47.4 g kg-fuel−1, respectively. The median BC EFs are 1.1 and 0.4 g kg-fuel−1in Chongqing and Beijing, respectively. In addition, a clear downward trend of BC EFs of on-road diesel trucks sampled in Beijing since 2008 is observed. Moreover, Beijing-registered trucks had the lowest BC EFs among the entire sample. These observations appear to reflect the effectiveness of emission standard and fuel quality standard implemented in Beijing (China IV) and nationwide (China III) in reducing BC (and likely overall particulate matter) emission. However, NOx EFs for Beijing-registered trucks did not show lower value than those from other regions. Unlike black carbon, there is no clear correlation between emission controls and NOx emissions from the sampled on-road trucks. Further analysis shows that trucks with high BC EFs do not usually have high NOx EFs, and vice versa, indicating that the current emission standards implemented in Beijing and nationwide have only limited impact on NOx emissions control. Therefore, effective multi-pollutant control strategies and in-use compliance programs are imperative to reduce the overall emissions from the transportation sector.},

	abstract = {Real time measurements of Black Carbon (BC) in PM2.5 aerosols were performed during AMMA and POLCA programs, between 2005 and 2010 in Cotonou (Benin), Dakar (Senegal), Bamako (Mali), and Yaounde (Cameroon). Indeed, BC was chosen as a metric because of its interest as an urban pollutant. The instrumented sites are representative of the traffic source. At Dakar, BC concentrations are high from November to April (13,000 ± 3500 ng m−3) and lower from May to September (8000 ± 3200 ng m−3). In dry season (November–April), high BC concentrations occurred as a result of northeasterly long-range transport of polluted air masses over West Africa, in addition to local emissions. However, during wet season (May–September) reduced traffic levels, school vacations and wet deposition processes contribute to lower BC concentration levels. Measured diurnal BC peak concentrations, at all sites, mainly occur during morning and evening rush-hour periods, indicating the paramount role of traffic. Highest values are observed between 5–9 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. depending on the site, while lowest are occurred at night time and middle afternoon when activities of the population are reduced. BC source apportionment from absorption measurements also confirmed the relative importance of traffic (88\%) versus biomass burning (12\%). Also, BC measurements were functions of days of the week, with highest values occurring on Fridays and lowest ones on Sundays. Spatial variations associated to BC levels are very different from one site to another, revealing different types of sources with strong variations at the regional scale. It appears that mean BC concentrations in Dakar are lower by a factor of two, compared to those observed in Bamako, but remain higher than in some other West African sites (e.g. Cotonou, Yaounde). Overall, BC concentrations in our different sites are comparable to reported European and Asian megacity levels. Finally, using measured BC/PM2.5 ratios, we have estimated PM2.5 mass concentrations in Dakar from June 2008 to June 2009 to be 44.4 ± 14.3 μg m−3, well above the WHO (2005) threshold of 10 μg m−3. This paper clearly highlights high pollution levels in West African large cities, with potential important impacts on the health of the regional population.},

Previous attempts failed to detect measurable reductions of PM mass pollution within the areas subject to traffic restriction. However black carbon, which is emitted primarily by traffic sources, could be a PM metric more suitable than PM mass to demonstrate pollutant reductions. In this study we report the results of a black carbon monitoring campaign carried out in Milan, Italy, with the aim to detect - and demonstrate more suitably than PM mass - differences in local urban air quality among three zones located very closely with different traffic intensity. The study was carried out in three different days by measuring simultaneously black carbon and PM mass concentrations with fixed monitoring stations located in three main radial roads connecting the outskirts to the city center, each with three segments: 1) an outer one, with no traffic restrictions 2) an intermediate one, subject to the congestion traffic charge called “Ecopass”, where a ticket is required to enter for cars equipped with engines prior to Euro 4 standard; 3) the pedestrian zone (no cars admitted) of Duomo Square in the city center, where each of the three main roads ends. The results demonstrated a sharply declining gradient in black carbon levels from the outer zone, without traffic restrictions, to the more central areas, for all of the three radial main roads. The differences in mean black carbon levels in the same day in the different traffic scheme locations were highly significant for each comparison. In contrast to the Black carbon results, mean PM10, PM2.5, PM1 concentrations did not show significant differences among the different traffic zones on the different campaign days. The ratio of black carbon to PM10 decreased by 47\% and 62\% in the Ecopass zone and in the pedestrian zone, respectively, as compared to the no-restriction zone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study showing that within-city proximal areas with different traffic intensity are associated with different black carbon levels. These data suggest that black carbon is a highly relevant metric of traffic pollution and should be taken into consideration in demonstrating the effectiveness of air quality mitigation measures.},

Many studies nowadays make the effort of determining personal exposure rather than estimating exposure at the residential address only. While intra-urban air pollution can be modeled quite easily using interpolation methods, estimating exposure in transport is more challenging. The aim of this study is to investigate which factors determine black carbon (BC) concentrations in transport microenvironments. Therefore personal exposure measurements are carried out using portable aethalometers, trip diaries and GPS devices. More than 1500 trips, both by active modes and by motorized transport, are evaluated in Flanders, Belgium. GPS coordinates are assigned to road segments to allow BC concentrations to be linked with trip and road characteristics (trip duration, degree of urbanization, road type, traffic intensity, travel speed and road speed). Average BC concentrations on highways (10.7 μg/m3) are comparable to concentrations on urban roads (9.6 μg/m3), but levels are significantly higher than concentrations on rural roads (6.1 μg/m3). Highways yield higher BC exposures for motorists compared to exposure on major roads and local roads. Overall BC concentrations are elevated at lower speeds (\&lt; 30 km/h) and at speeds above 80 km/h, in accordance to vehicle emission functions. Driving on roads with low traffic intensities resulted in lower exposures than driving on roads with higher traffic intensities (from 5.6 μg/m3 for roads with less than 500 veh/h, up to 12 μg/m3 for roads with over 2500 veh/h). Traffic intensity proved to be the major explanatory variable for in-vehicle BC exposure, together with timing of the trip and urbanization. For cyclists and pedestrians the range in BC exposure is smaller and models are less predictive; for active modes exposure seems to be influenced by timing and degree of urbanization only.},

These factors spanned a range of greater than two orders of magnitude, representing the emission of from 4 × 10−6 to 10−3 grams of aerosol black carbon per gram of carbon consumed in the fuel. Their distribution showed that 20 percent of the vehicles accounted for 65 percent of the emissions. The real-time measurement methodology allows for a determination of the distribution of emission factors across the actual population of sources.

Fuels have been reformulated and vehicle technologies have advanced, so an updated assessment of vehicular emissions is needed. Gas- and particle-phase pollutant concentrations were measured in the Caldecott Tunnel in the San Francisco Bay Area during the summer of 1996. Separate samples were collected for uphill traffic in two tunnel bores:? one bore was influenced by heavy-duty diesel truck emissions; a second bore was reserved for light-duty vehicles. Fine particle black carbon and PAH concentrations were normalized to fuel consumption to compute emission factors. Light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty diesel trucks emitted, respectively, 30 ± 2 and 1440 ± 160 mg of fine black carbon particles per kg of fuel burned. Diesel trucks were the major source of lighter PAH, whereas light-duty gasoline vehicles were the dominant source of higher molecular weight PAH such as benzo[a]pyrene and dibenz[a,h]anthracene. Size-resolved measurements of particulate PAH showed significant fractions of diesel-derived PAH to be present in both the ultrafine size mode ({\textless}0.12 ?m) and the ac cumulation mode (0.12?2 ?m). In contrast, gasoline engine-derived PAH emissions were found almost entirely in the ultrafine mode.},

In order to get a clear picture of the evolution of the PM in different size classes, the in-tunnel locations ranged from curb-side to different locations inside the exhaust air system. Additional measurements were performed in the ambient air at curb-side at a street crossing as well as in urban background. At those times when heavy traffic occurs, tunnel measurements show size distributions similar to those derived from engine/vehicle measurements. During times with little traffic the size distributions are closer to those recorded in ambient air. As soon as the traffic load increases the size distribution changes, due to rapid coagulation of the smallest particles with the accumulation mode. As the travel time of the particles through the tunnel and up the stacks is very long “aging” effects could be observed. Thus, these spectra are quite different from ambient measurements in urban air, especially in the region above 30–40 nm.},

The number concentration of soot mode particles varied within a factor of two for different engine conditions while the concentration of nucleation mode particles varied up to two orders of magnitude. The results show that roadside measurements are still quite different from those behind the tailpipe. Beside dilution transformation processes within the first meter behind the tailpipe also play an important role, such as nucleation and growth. Emission factors were calculated and compared with those obtained by other studies. Emission factors for particles larger than 25 nm (primary emissions) varied within 1.1 × 1014 km−1 and 2.7 × 1014 km−1 for the diesel car and between 0.6 × 1012 km−1 and 3.5 × 1012 km−1 for the gasoline car.

Yearly median particle number concentrations for Budapest, Prague and Vienna were 10.6\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;103, 7.3\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;103 and 8.0\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;103\&\#xa0;cm−\&\#xa0;3.

Mean contributions of ultrafine particles (particles with a mobility diameter \&lt;\&\#xa0;100\&\#xa0;nm) to the total number concentration were 80\%, 84\% and 74\% for Budapest, Prague and Vienna, thus these particles represent an overwhelming share of all particles in each city. Seasonal variation of particle number concentrations was not obvious. Diurnal variations of particles with a diameter between 100 and 1000\&\#xa0;nm (N100–1000) exhibited similar shape for the cities, which was related to the time-activity pattern of inhabitants and regional influences. The structure of the diurnal variation for ultrafine particles was also similar. It contained a huge morning peak in each city which was explained by emissions from vehicular traffic. The second peak was shifted from afternoon rush hours to late evenings as a result of the daily cycling in meteorological parameters. The character of the measurement site also influenced the diurnal variation. Diurnal variation of the mean ratio of ultrafine particles to N100–1000 clearly revealed the presence and importance of new particle formation and subsequent growth in urban environments. Nucleation frequencies in Budapest and Prague were 27\% and 23\%, respectively on a yearly time scale.

                internal structure. Inversion of the VSF thus provides information about the
                particle population. The commercially available LISST instrument measures the
                scattering at near forward angles to estimate the bulk size distribution of
                particles larger than about 1 μm. By using scattering over the full
                angular range (0°–180°), the recently improved VSF-inversion method
                    [X. Zhang, M. Twardowski, and M. Lewis, Appl. Opt. 50, 1240 (2011).10.1364/AO.50.001240APOPAI0003-6935] can
                characterize particles in terms of particle subpopulations, which are described by
                their unique size distribution and composition. Concurrent deployments of the
                Multispectral Volume Scattering Meter and the LISST in three coastal waters (i.e.,
                Chesapeake Bay, Mobile Bay, and Monterey Bay) allowed us to compare the size
                distributions derived from these two different methods. We also obtained indirect
                validation of the results for submicrometer particles and for the composition of
                particles provided by the VSF-inversion method. For particle sizes ranging from 1 to
                100 μm, the concentration was shown to vary over 10 orders of magnitude,
                and excellent agreement was found between the two methods with a mean relative
                difference less than 10\% for the total size distributions. The inversion results
                also reproduced spectral variations in the shape of the VSF, although these spectral
                variations were not frequently observed in our study. The increased backscattering
                towards the shorter wavelengths was explained by the stronger influence of
                submicrometer particles affecting the backscattering. Based on published
                measurements of cell sizes and intracellular chlorophyll-a [Chl] concentrations over
                a wide range of phytoplankton species and strains, [Chl] was estimated for the
                inverted subpopulations that were identified as phytoplankton based on their
                refractive index and mean sizes. The estimated [Chl] agreed well with the
                fluorescence-based estimates in both magnitude and trend, thus reproducing a bloom
                event observed at a time series station.},

The amount of BC in the total mass of the suspended particulate matter (TSP) were estimated by comparing the average BC with mass of particulate matter simultaneously measured with frm Omni Ambient Air Sampler for the last two months (March-April, 2010). BC concentration shows significant temporal variation with monthly mean concentration varying between 14.9 μg/m3 and 3.0 μg/m3. The highest daily mean concentration was recorded as high as 39.9 μg/m3. The highest concentration of BC occurred during winter and pre-monsoon seasons. The lowest concentration of BC was found during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. A distinct diurnal variation of BC with two high peaks occurred; one in around 09:00 morning and another late evening around 20:00 local time. Minimum BC concentration was also observed in the afternoon. The annual average of BC for observation period was 8.6 ± 4.4 μg /m3.The seasonal, monthly and diurnal variation of BC were found to be significantly influenced by the local traffic movements, the domestic and industrial fuel consuming activities, wind speed ,wind direction and rain. The amount of BC in the total mass of particulate matters during the observed period varied between 11.6 and 56.2 percent. This variation is attributed to the high amount of re-suspension of dust particles in the atmosphere of the valley.},

The emission factors used are developed considering specific European conditions. The main sources of carbonaceous aerosols in Europe are emissions from traffic and residential combustion of solid fuels. Between 1990 and 2000, the BC and OC emissions are estimated to decline from 0.89 to 0.68 Tg and from 1.4 to 1.0 Tg, respectively. Most of the reduction occurred in the early 1990s in Eastern Europe owing to structural changes that resulted in energy efficiency improvements in industry and lower consumption of solid fuels in residential-commercial sector; the latter having strong impact on BC and OC emissions. Furthermore, the growth in transport volumes, and expected increase in emissions, was offset by introduction of stricter legislation for road transport from 1995. Focusing on the most important sectors, transport and residential combustion, the variation in measured carbonaceous emission shares and its impact on total emissions was evaluated. This analysis indicates a range of about -25\% to +20\% for BC and -7\% and +15\% for OC, compared to the central case.},

	abstract = {In 2006 a large transformation was carried out on the public transportation system in Santiago de Chile. The original system (before 2006) had hundreds of bus owners with about 7000 diesel buses. The new system has only 13 firms with about 5900 buses which operate in different parts of the city with little overlap between them. In this work we evaluate the impact of the Transantiago system on the black carbon pollution along four roads directly affected by the modification to the transport system. Measurements were carried out during May – July of 2005 (before Transantiago) and June – July of 2007 (after Transantiago) We have used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to evaluate black carbon concentration in four streets in year 2005 and 2007. The results show that a statistically significant reduction between year 2005 (before Transantiago) and year 2007 (after Transantiago) in Alameda street, which changed from a mean of 18.8 μg/m3 in 2005 to 11.9 μg/m3 in 2007. In this street there was a decrease in the number of buses as well as the number of private vehicles and an improvement in the technology of public transportation between those years. Other two streets (Usach and Departamental) did not change or experienced a small increase in the black carbon concentration in spite of having less flux of buses in 2007. Eliodoro Yañez Street, which did not have public transportation in 2005 or 2007 experienced a 15\% increase in the black carbon concentration between those years. Analysis of the data indicates that the change is related to a decrease in the total number of vehicles or the number of other diesel vehicles in the street rather than a decrease in the number of buses only. These results are an indication that in order to decrease pollution near a street is not enough to reduce the number of buses or improve its quality, but to reduce the total number of vehicles.},

Despite their importance, motor vehicle emissions are inadequately understood and quantified, esp. in developing countries. In this study, the real-world emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NO) were measured using an on-road remote sensing system at five sites in Hangzhou, China in 2004 and 2005. Average emission factors of CO, HC and NOx for petrol vehicles of different model year, technology class and vehicle type were calculated in grams of pollutant per unit of fuel use (g l-1) from approximately 32,260 petrol vehicles. Because the availability of data used in traditional on-road mobile source estimation methodologies is limited in China, fuel-based approach was implemented to estimate motor vehicle emissions using fuel sales as a measure of vehicle activity, and exhaust emissions factors from remote sensing measurements. The fuel-based exhaust emission inventories were also compared with the results from the recent international vehicle emission (IVE) model. Results show that petrol vehicle fleet in Hangzhou has significantly high CO emissions, relatively high HC and low NOx, with the average emission factors of 193.07±15.63, 9.51±2.40 and 5.53±0.48 g l-1, respectively. For year 2005 petrol vehicles exhaust emissions contributed with 182,013±16,936, 9107±2255 and 5050±480 metric ton yr-1 of CO, HC and NOx, respectively. The inventories are 45.5\% higher, 6.6\% higher and 53.7\% lower for CO, HC and NOx, respectively, than the estimates using IVE travel-based model. In addition, a number of insights about the emission distributions and formation mechanisms have been obtained from an in-depth analysis of these results.},

The CIT Photochemical Airshed Model is used to compute CO concentration distributions arising from 29 separate source domains in the South Coast Air Basin of California. A Kalman filter integrated within the model matches predictions with CO observations at 27 locations by superposing the computed distributions with optimal weighting factors. The filter structure allows control of the extent to which adjusted emission inventories are allowed to deviate from a base-case, which already has high spatial and temporal definition. Applied to the Southern California Air Quality Study, 27-29 August 1987, strong temporal dependence was noted in the necessary adjustment to the available CO emission inventory, with a peak factor of 3.0 at midday on weekdays. The spatial resolution of the technique revealed new high-emission zones for CO in a corridor between Pasadena and San Bernardino, in the Riverside-Corona area, and along the Pacific coast on Saturday. In this first such application to an urban environment, some success was also achieved in correcting the phasing of emissions for errors arising from the neglect of source-receptor lags in the inverse modelling technique.},

	abstract = {During June and July 2003 the Sources and Origins of Atmospheric Cloud Droplets experiment (SOACED) was carried out on a mountain-top site in central Sweden. The main objective of the experiment was to characterise the microphysical and chemical properties of cloud droplet residuals and interstitial aerosol particles in continental clouds and to understand the processes controlling cloud properties at this location.
Interstitial and residual aerosol size distributions, cloud liquid water content and species- and size-resolved aerosol mass concentrations are the main variables employed to address questions pertaining to the cloud droplet number concentration and scavenging efficiency during a stratocumulus cloud event observed on July 28, 2003. In this cloud event, about 56\% of the aerosol mass was associated with organic species, whilst SO4 accounted for 23\% and NH4 for 14\%. NO3 and Cl made up about 7\% of the total mass.
The partitioning of the aerosol particles between cloud droplets and interstitial air has been studied in terms of their microphysical properties. The scavenging efficiency, defined as the fraction of particles activated into cloud elements compared to the total amount of particles, was investigated as a function of size. The scavenging efficiency curves displayed different shapes during the cloud event, from an S-shaped curve, with low scavenging efficiency in the Aitken mode and larger scavenging efficiency in the accumulation mode, to more unusual shapes where Aitken-mode particles were either solely activated or activated in addition to accumulation-mode particles.
This study suggests that alterations of the aerosol chemical composition occurred during the measurement period, changing the hygroscopic nature of the CCN and decreasing their activation diameter. It is also hypothesized that entrainment of drier air aloft may have introduced inhomogeneities in the supersaturation field and modified the S-shaped scavenging curves.},

	abstract = {Six methods for measuring the shortwave absorption and/or black carbon (BC) content of aerosols from biomass burning were compared during the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) experiment. The methods were the optical extinction cell (OEC), integrating plate (IP), optical reflectance (OR), particle soot/absorption photometer (PSAP), thermal evolution (TE), and remote sensing (RS). Comparisons were made for individual smoke plumes and for regional hazes dominated by smoke. Taking the OEC as a primary standard, measurements of the absorption coefficient (σ a ) showed that the OR method had the lowest uncertainty (17\%) in σ a . The other optical methods had uncertainties ranging from 20 to 40\%. However, with sufficient sample size, the values of σ a derived from the optical methods converged to within 20\% of each other. For biomass burning aerosols in regional hazes over Brazil, this led to systematic differences of �0.02 in the values of the single-scattering albedo derived from the various in situ techniques. It was found also that the BC content of the aerosol and σ a were poorly correlated. This is likely due to a large uncertainty in the BC content of the aerosol measured by TE, and/or a high variability in the mass absorption efficiency of BC in biomass burning aerosol. Hence there is a high uncertainty in inferring σ a from the BC content of smoke aerosol.},

Because of that, local authorities implemented a few years ago an air quality monitoring network with eight monitoring stations located across the whole city. These stations continuously collect information about the presence and level of atmospheric contaminants as well as meteorological indices.
As the budget for this activity is limited, to increase the monitoring network as the city grows might be an inefficient decision. To evaluate alternative decisions multiple criteria should be consider. A statistical evaluation of some low cost modifications of the network becomes a valid research topic. This paper attempts to optimize Santiago's atmospheric monitoring network by excluding the least informative stations with respect to the variables under study: carbon monoxide (CO), airborne particulate material (PM10), ozone (O3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). To accomplish this, an index of multivariate effectiveness, based on Shannon information index, is applied to that network.},

	abstract = {Chile has a long tradition of exploiting mineral resources, particularly copper (Cu). One of the largest Cu smelters, Caletones, located some 150 km south of the country's capital, Santiago, in Central Chile, is responsible for about 0.4\% of about 70 Tg S/yr oxidized sulfur (SOx) emitted by anthropogenic sources worldwide. Santiago, a megacity with 5 million inhabitants, stands for about 5 Gg S/yr. The average meteorological conditions are unfavorable for the dispersion of pollutants in this area. All this poses risks for human health and vegetation. Also, downwind from these polluted areas there may be large-scale impacts on cloud properties and on oxidative cycles. Here, we present the first attempt to assess the regional distribution of SOx in Central Chile using a dispersion model (MATCH) driven with data from a limited area weather forecast model (HIRLAM). Emphasis has been given to the impact of Cu smelters upon urban air quality, particularly that of Santiago. Six 1-month long periods were simulated for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. These periods span over a broad range of typical meteorological conditions in the area including El Niño and La Niña years. Estimates of the regional dispersion and deposition patterns were calculated. The emissions from the large Cu smelters dominate the distribution of SOx. A budget of SOx over an area of 200×200 km2 around Santiago is presented. There is too low a number of monitoring stations to perform a detailed evaluation of MATCH. Nevertheless, the model reproduces consistently all the regional-scale characteristics that can be derived from the available observations.},

	abstract = {Air pollutants in Santiago (33.5°S, 70.8°W, 500 m a.s.l.), a city with 5 million inhabitants, located in a basin in Central Chile surrounded by the high Andes, frequently exceed air quality standards. This affects human health and it stresses vegetation. The most extreme winter and fall pollution events occur when the subsident regime of the Pacific high is further enhanced by coastal lows (CLs), which bring down the base of the subsidence inversion. Under these conditions, the air quality worsens significantly giving rise to acute air pollution episodes. We assess the ability of a regional transport/chemistry/deposition model (MATCH) coupled to a meteorological model (High Resolution Limited Area Model--HIRLAM) to simulate the evolution of oxidized sulfur (SOx) in connection with intensive CLs. We focus on SOx since it is an environmental issue of concern, and the emissions and concentrations of SOx have been regularly monitored making it easier to bracket model outputs for SOx than for other pollutants. Furthermore, the SOx emissions in the area are very large, i.e., about 0.4\% of the global anthropogenic sources. Comparisons with observations indicate that the combination of HIRLAM and MATCH is a suitable tool for describing the regional patterns of dispersion associated with CLs. However, the low number and the limited geographical coverage of reliable air quality data preclude a complete evaluation of the model. Nevertheless, we show evidence of an enhanced contribution of the largest copper smelter in the area, i.e., Caletones, to the burden of SOx in the Santiago basin, especially in the form of sulfate associated to fine particles (diameters {\textless}2.5 [mu]m), during CLs. Further, we speculate that the Caletones plume may trigger or promote secondary aerosol formation during CLs in the Santiago basin.},

	abstract = {To adequately assess the effects of atmospheric aerosols on climate, their optical constants (scattering and absorption coefficients) must be known. The absorption and scattering coefficients of the aerosols are derived from the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index and are dependent on their size and chemical composition. Because aerosol properties vary significantly with location, it is difficult to assign values for the absorption and scattering of solar radiation by aerosols in models of global climate change. This study reports a new method of collecting size-fractionated atmospheric aerosol samples for the purpose of directly measuring their transmission and reflectance spectra followed by the determination of the complex refractive index across the entire atmospherically relevant spectral range. The samples were collected with a modified Sierra high-volume cascade impactor with the usual filter collection surfaces replaced with Teflon sheets machined to hold quartz (ultraviolet [UV]/visible transparent) and/or silver chloride (infrared transparent) sample collection plates. Reflectance and transmission spectra can be obtained on the aerosol samples directly as a function of wavelength, from 280 nm to 2.5 m, with an integrating sphere coupled to an UV/visible or a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer. The effective real and imaginary components of the refractive index of the bulk sample material can then be approximated, as a function of wavelength, from the sample spectra. Preliminary results are presented for carbon soot samples generated in the laboratory and for standard diesel soot samples in the UV/visible spectral range. These are compared to results obtained for size-fractionated atmospheric aerosol samples collected near Pasco, WA, West Mesa, AZ, and Argonne, IL.},

	doi = {10.1016/0960-1686(93)90104-7},
	abstract = {The atmosphere interacts both with incoming as well as outgoing light. Two main processes take place: light scattering and light absorption. Whereas light scattering redistributes any ligh energy in the atmosphere, light absorption converts the light energy to internal energy of the absorbing molecules and eventually transfers it to the surrounding gas as heat.
Atmospheric gases absorb light in distinct spectral regions usually at more or less broad bands. Best known is the broad absorption of ozone in the far u.v., being essential for the existence of the biological macromolecules on Earth. Gases known as greenhouse gases, e.g. CO2, CH4, N2O and water vapor absorb a wide range of infrared radiation, and thus are responsible for the greenhouse effects. Since the lifetime of these gases (except water vapor) is considerable, their distribution around the globe is fairly homogeneous.
The atmospheric aerosol gives the major contribution to the atmospheric light absorption in the visible and near u.v. and near i.r. Graphitic (black) carbon, the main constituent of soot, is almost exclusively responsible for the light absorption of the particles. The light absorption by aerosols is continuous and covers the whole visible spectral range. It only depends slightly on wavelength.
The optical properties of elemental carbon are determined by the size of the particles and their complex refractive index. A variety of refractive indices can be found in the literature for elemental carbon, most likely caused by different production and thus composition of the particles. Soot particles are very efficient in attenuating light; for the average size the particles have more than twice the mass extinction coefficient compared to transparent particles such as ammonium sulfate. The light absorption coefficient of a mixture of elemental carbon and transparent materials is higher for internal than for external mixtures. When incorporated into transparent particles, the absorption properties of elemental carbon can be multiplied and the single scattering albedo will decrease in comparison to an external mixture of the same materials.
There are different methods to measure the light absorption coefficient of suspended particles. They can be separated in three groups, depending on the effect or methodology they use, but no standard procedure has been adopted so far.
Soot is produced by all combusttion processes. Since most fires on Earth are due to humans, then indirectly humans are the major source of light-absorbing aerosol particles. On a global scale black carbon amounts to 1.1-2.5\% of the anthropogenic particles and to 0.2-1\% of the total emitted particles. The emission factors for elemental carbon are highest for small sources such as diesel motors or fireplaces.
The light-absorbing aerosol consists of fine particles, with most particles having diameters less than a few tenths of a micrometer. Particles in the size range of soot particles have an average lifetime of 7 days in the atmosphere, therefore they can be transported over large distances and are also found in remote regions. Since light-absorbing particles have a variety of sources and sinks and they are involved in precipitation cycles, their distribution on the globe is inhomogeneous. Light-absorption coefficients of the atmospheric aerosol reported in the literature differ by more than four orders of magnitudes at different locations, but nevertheless black carbon particles have been found even at very remote areas, such as the South Pole.
Although light-absorbing particles are a minority component in the atmospheric aerosol, their effects cannot be neglected: since the mass extinction coefficient of soot is higher by a factor of two to three compared to transparent particles, light-absorbing substances in the atmosphere can cause at some locations up to half of the visibility reduction; light-absorbing substances in the atmosphere can be responsible for the brown appearance of urban hazes and the discoloration of the sky.
The light absorption of the atmosphere in the visible (which mainly is due to particulate matter) has to be taken into account when considering radiative properties and climatic consequences. A small temperature increase due to absorption in the visible is to be expected. The value is around a few tenths of a Kelvin, but no general statement on its magnitude is possible, since a large spatial and temporal variation exists and other factors like surface albedo, the optical depth of the aerosol, its incorporation in clouds and humidity growth of the aerosol have to be considered.},

	abstract = {Two and a half years (June 2002 to September 2004) of air pollution and meteorological parameters in a street canyon in Stockholm were analyzed. A distinctive dependence of particle number concentration, normalized by NOx, with ambient temperature was found. By comparison with NOx, it is concluded that this variation is not related to variability in the emissions nor due to changes in atmospheric dilution. The observed ratio between total particle number and NOx increases from ca. [150±60] particles per picogram of NOx [] at to [380±50] [] at . The increase in particle number concentration with decreasing temperatures is different for different particle sizes. For particle sizes smaller than 40 nm the variation is more pronounced while for particle sizes larger than 100 nm the change is not statistically significant. This reflects the impact of temperature dependent processes that affect mainly particles smaller than 100 nm in diameter. Modeling results indicate that condensation of volatile compounds onto pre-existing aerosols gives similar changes in the particle size distribution as those observed. Coagulation is shown to have only minor effects on the particle size distribution. Even though, with the present data set is not possible to quantify the impact of an increased nucleation rate with low temperatures, it was shown that nucleation mode particles are largely influenced by relative humidity with high concentrations during high relative humidity periods and therefore it is expected that for cold periods, when the relative humidity is higher, nucleation is enhanced by the water content of the air.},

Nevertheless, the non-CO 2 climate effects are large in comparison to the CO 2 effect, in particular for aviation and shipping. This is mainly due to triggering new clouds and modifying existing clouds, and to the impact of nitrogen oxides emissions on the abundances of ozone and methane.},

	abstract = {From 2005-2009 there was a 40\% decrease in the number of days on which the European daily limit value of PM10 was exceeded at traffic locations in European cities. Yet, in many of these cities, air quality is still not in compliance with the European Air Quality Directive and additional traffic measures are planned. Our study shows that elemental carbon (EC) is a more appropriate indicator than PM2.5 and PM10 for evaluating the impact of traffic measures on air quality and health. The modelled improvement in EC concentration was translated in life years gained as a result of a traffic measure. This was investigated for a speed management zone on a motorway in the city of Rotterdam. Eighty-five per cent of those living within 400 m of the motorway gained 0-1 months of life expectancy and another 15\% gained 1-3 months, depending on their distance from the motorway. In addition, EC was used to evaluate a low emission zone in Amsterdam, specifically for those living along inner-urban roads with intense traffic levels. The zone only restricts heavy duty vehicles with Euro emission class 0 to 2, Euro 3 older than eight years or more recent Euro 3 without diesel particulate filter. The results indicate a population-weighted, average gain of 0.2 months in life expectancy as compared with a maximum potential gain of 2.9 months. It is concluded that on motorways speed management is an effective measure, while a low emission zone as implemented in our case study, is less effective to reduce health effects of road traffic emissions. For inner-urban roads reduction of traffic volume seems the most effective traffic measure for improving air quality and health.},

Alternative are models that are basically parameterised semi-empirical models making use of a priori assumptions about the flow and dispersion conditions. However, these models must, be thoroughly tested and their performance and limitations carefully documented. The Danish Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM) belongs to this category of parameterised models. In the OSPM, concentrations of exhaust gases are calculated using a combination of a plume model for the direct contribution and a box model for the recirculating part of the pollutants in the street. Parameterisation of flow and dispersion conditions in street canyons was deduced from extensive analysis of experimental data and model tests. Results of these tests were used to further improve the model performance, especially with regard to different street configurations and a variety of meteorological conditions.},

	abstract = {A study was conducted to determine the relationship between light absorption measurements from an aethalometer and a particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP) and black carbon mass concentrations across Canadian environments ranging from urban to remote areas. To achieve this, filter samples were collected for thermal analysis of black carbon simultaneously with light absorption measurements at several locations in Canada. Previously, it has been shown that the k relating particle light absorption to black carbon measured with an aethalometer changes with age, type, and composition of the aerosol, which varies with time and by space [Liousse et al., 1993; Petzold and Niessner, 1995; Lavanchy et al., 1999; Ruellan and Cachier, 2000]. Consequently, to convert light absorption measurements to the black carbon mass, the standard values used for k of 19 m2 g−1 for aethalometer and 10 m2 g−1 for PSAP, respectively, need to be fine-tuned to fit the conditions at the site of interest to obtain the site-specific attenuation, referred to as k(S.S.). Our results also indicate that k(S.S.) varies; on a broad scale, from remote continental to rural, suburban, and urban locations and from winter to summer and, on a small scale, within an urban area and from measurement to measurement at a single location. The range of median k(S.S) values observed was from 6.4 m2 g−1 to 20.1 m2 g−1. We suggest that the variability is connected to the distribution of sources and processes contributing to the carbonaceous aerosols at the sites.},

Carbon monoxide and nitric oxide show increasing emissions with increased altitude. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions have decreased with more recent model years over the last 10 years but are the same as vehicles that are 20 years old. At the Golden, CO site, there was a statistically significant decrease in fleet emissions of CO and NOx since a similar study in 1999. There was no emission trend for CO or NOx with gross vehicle weight or odometer in units of grams of pollutant per kilogram of fuel consumed. Data from this study suggest that on-road remote sensing can detect illegal, high sulfur fuel use from individual heavy-duty diesel trucks. Ammonia emissions from this study were below the detection limit of the instrument but will be useful as a baseline value for future comparison.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess particle number concentrations (PNCs) and distributions (PNDs) in a car cabin while driving. Further objectives include the determination of the influence of particle transformation processes on PNCs, PNDs and estimation of PNC related exposure. On–board measurements of PNCs and PNDs were made in the 5–560 nm size range using a fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS50), which has a response time of 500ms. Video records of the traffic ahead of the experimental car were also used to correlate emission events with measured PNCs and PNDs. A total of 30 return trips was made on a 2.7 kilometres route during morning and evening rush hours, with journey times of 7±2 and 10±3 minutes, respectively. The average PNC for the set of morning journeys, 5.79±3.52×104 cm−3, was found to be nearly identical to the average recorded during the afternoon, 5.95±4.67×104 cm−3. Average PNCs for individual trips varied from 2.42×104 cm−3 to 2.18×105 cm−3, mainly due to changes in the emissions affecting the experimental car (e.g. when the experimental car was following another vehicle). The largest one second averaged PNC during a specific event, 1.85×106 cm−3, was found to be over 30–times greater than the overall–average of 5.87±4.06×104 cm−3. Correlation of video records and concentration data indicated that close proximity to a preceding vehicle led to a clear increase in PNCs of freshly emitted nucleation mode particles. The evolution of normalised PNDs demonstrated that dilution was the dominant transformation process in the car cabin. The deposition of inhaled particles in the lung was estimated on the basis of either the size–resolved distribution or the total PNC. In general, the two methods yielded similar results but differences up to 30\% were noted in some cases, with the latter method giving the lower values. Overall, the results reflect the importance of size–resolved measurements for deriving accurate evaluations of exposure rates, as well as identifying emissions from nearby traffic as the cause of short term elevations of PNCs and hence dose rates.},

	abstract = {To assess the effect of the indoor environment on the urban fate of organic chemicals, an 8-compartment indoor-inclusive steady state multimedia chemical fate model was developed. The model includes typical urban compartments (air, soil, water, sediment, and urban film) and a novel module representing a generic indoor environment. The model was parameterized to the municipality of Stockholm, Sweden and applied to four organic chemicals with different physical–chemical characteristics and use patterns: formaldehyde, 2,4,6-tribromophenol, di-ethylhexylphthalate and decabromodiphenyl ether. The results show that emissions to indoor air may increase the steady state mass and residence time in the urban environment by a factor of 1.1 to 22 for the four chemicals, compared to if emissions are assigned to outdoor air. This is due to the nested nature of the indoor environment, which creates a physical barrier that prevents chemicals from leaving the urban system with outflowing air. For DEHP and BDE 209, the additional partitioning to indoor surfaces results in a greater importance of the indoor removal pathways from surfaces. The outdoor environmental concentrations of these chemicals are predicted to be lower if emitted to indoor air than if emitted to outdoor air because of the additional indoor removal pathways of dust and indoor film, leading to loss of chemical from the system. For formaldehyde and 2,4,6-TBP outdoor environmental concentrations are not affected by whether the release occurs indoors or outdoors because of the limited partitioning to indoor surfaces. A sensitivity analysis revealed that there appears to be a relationship between logKOA and the impact of the ventilation rate on the urban fate of organic chemicals.},

	abstract = {The "Stockholm Trial" involved a road pricing system to improve the air quality and reduce traffic congestion. The test period of the trial was January 3-July 31, 2006. Vehicles travelling into and out of the charge cordon were charged for every passage during weekdays. The amount due varied during the day and was highest during rush hours (20 SEK = 2.2 EUR, maximum 60 SEK per day). Based on measured and modelled changes in road traffic it was estimated that this system resulted in a 15\% reduction in total road use within the charged cordon. Total traffic emissions in this area of NOx and PM10 fell by 8.5\% and 13\%, respectively. Air quality dispersion modelling was applied to assess the effect of the emission reductions on ambient concentrations and population exposure. For the situations with and without the trial, meteorological conditions and other emissions than from road traffic were kept the same. The calculations show that, with a permanent congestion tax system like the Stockholm Trial, the annual average NOx concentrations would be lower by up to 12\% along the most densely trafficked streets. PM10 concentrations would be up to 7\% lower. The limit values for both PM10 and NO2 would still be exceeded along the most densely trafficked streets. The total population exposure of NOx in Greater Stockholm (35 × 35 km with 1.44 million people) is estimated to decrease with a rather modest 0.23 [mu]g m-3. However, based on a long-term epidemiological study, that found an increased mortality risk of 8\% per 10 [mu]g m-3 NOx, it is estimated that 27 premature deaths would be avoided every year. According to life-table analysis this would correspond to 206 years of life gained over 10 years per 100 000 people following the trial if the effects on exposures would persist. The effect on mortality is attributed to road traffic emissions (likely vehicle exhaust particles); NOx is merely regarded as an indicator of traffic exposure. This is only the tip of the ice-berg since reductions are expected in both respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity. This study demonstrates the importance of not only assessing the effects on air quality limit values, but also to make quantitative estimates of health impacts, in order to justify actions to reduce air pollution.},

Pollutant concentrations were measured adjacent to the airfield and passenger terminal at the Roanoke Regional Airport in Virginia. Observed NOx emission indices (EIs) for jet-powered, commuter aircraft were generally lower than those contained in the International Civil Aviation Organization databank for both taxi and takeoff engine settings. NOx EIs ranged from 1.9 to 3.7 g (kg fuel)-1 across five types of aircraft during taxiing, while EIs were consistently higher, 8.8 to 20.6 g (kg fuel)-1, during takeoff. Particle number EIs ranged from 1.4 ? 1015 to 7.1 ? 1015 (kg fuel)-1 and were slightly higher in taxi mode than in takeoff mode for four of the five types of aircraft. Diurnal patterns in CO2 and NOx concentrations were influenced mainly by atmospheric conditions, while patterns in particle number concentrations were attributable mainly to patterns in aircraft activity. CO2 and NOx fluxes measured by eddy covariance were higher at the terminal than at the airfield and were lower than found in urban areas.},

	abstract = {Columnar and ground level aerosol properties as well as mass concentrations of some gaseous pollutants were measured at two urban sites (Granada and Málaga, South Spain) before, during and after an extended stagnation episode from 7 to 13 February 2011. This long lasting event was associated with a very strong and persistent blocking high-pressure system over the Iberian Peninsula, together with very intense and persistent temperature inversions near the ground level. The columnar aerosol load at Granada showed a significant increase during this stagnation episode as indicated by aerosol optical depth at 440 nm, reaching values four times higher (0.6) than before and after the event. A significant increase in aerosol load at night time was also evidenced by star photometer measurements. Similarly, pronounced enhancement in columnar aerosol load was observed at Málaga, indicating the regional extension of this event. Analysis of ground level measurements obtained at Granada showed a significant increase in aerosol scattering coefficients and aerosol number concentrations during the stagnation episode. Furthermore, the analysis of aerosol size distribution measurements has evidenced the large contribution of fine particles at ground level as well as in the atmospheric column during the stagnation period. The fine mode radius measured at Granada showed a large displacement towards larger sizes together with a pronounced increase in the geometric standard deviation of the fine mode during the high pollution event in the morning hours on 9 February. This was attributed to the growth of aerosol particles due to coagulation and condensation processes as a result of the high fine aerosol load next to the surface favoured by the high pressure system and thermal inversion on that day. This increases in the radius and width of the fine mode results in more efficient scattering in the 440-1020 nm spectral range which, in combination with nearly constant and low imaginary refractive index (0.002) leads to high single scattering albedo with neutral spectral dependency. During the persistent temperature inversion episode the daily European PM10 mass concentration limit (50 μg m−3) was exceeded in Granada for most days and in Málaga for three consecutive days. Nevertheless, the mass concentrations of NO2, CO and O3 were below the European thresholds with a noticeable decrease in O3 mass concentration at both sites.},

The mean PM 1 mass concentration measured was 47.9 ± 17.0 μg·m −3 during the campaign, with organic aerosol (OA) and sulfate being the two dominant species, accounting for 36.3\% and 20.9\% of the total mass, respectively, followed by black carbon (17.1\%, measured by an aethalometer), nitrate (12.9\%), ammonium (9.6\%) and chloride (3.1\%). The average size distributions of the species (except black carbon) were dominated by an accumulation mode peaking at ∼550 nm. Calculations based on high-resolution organic mass spectrum showed that, C, H, O and N on average contributed 58.1\%, 7.3\%, 30.7\%, and 3.9\% to the total organic mass, respectively. The average ratio of organic mass over organic carbon mass (OM/OC) was 1.73 ± 0.08. Four components of OA were identified by the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis, including a hydrocarbon-like (HOA), a biomass burning (BBOA) and two oxygenated (SV-OOA and LV-OOA) organic aerosol components, which on average accounted for 18.0\%, 14.3\%, 28.8\% and 38.9\% of the total organic mass, respectively.},

	abstract = {Haze episodes in the North China Plain (NCP) have attracted intensive attentions due to their significant impacts on the regional and global climate. Surface measurements of aerosol microphysical and optical properties in Tanggu, a coast city in NCP from June 12 to July 8, 2011 were carried out. The aim of this study was to evaluate the summertime haze episodes from different source regions identified by the air-mass back-trajectories. A highest percentage of coarse particles (diameter larger than 1 μm), consistent with lowest scattering Angstrom exponent were observed in haze episodes with pollutions from only local areas. The up-scatter fraction and asymmetry parameter were similar for all haze episodes with the median values of 0.24 and 0.66, respectively, since hemispherical backscatter ratio reached the limit of ∼0.10. The haze episode with the air masses from eastern coast seems to have a more effective heating effect on the atmosphere, which also exhibited significant enhancements in aerosol concentrations and optical parameters. The larger median single scattering albedos of 0.85 and 0.87 were found for haze episodes with air masses from oceanic regions and eastern coast of China, respectively. The median single scattering albedo for haze episodes with air masses from northeast China was lowest among all haze episodes. Our study indicates that the long-range transport aids the formation of haze episodes.},

	abstract = {During the years 2008–2009, studies were conducted on PM10 in the atmosphere over Gdynia. The basic chemical composition of PM10 aerosols (inorganic species, organic and elemental carbon) was measured during periods of heightened health risk. As the quality of air depends on natural as well as anthropogenic factors, it was important to specify which of these factors prevail under different synoptic conditions and at different times, and which have the greatest influence on human health.

In the course of the 24-month research period, the daily PM10 limit value (50 μg.m- 3) in the coastal zone of the Gulf of Gdansk, was exceeded 25 times. High concentration episodes invariably occurred in the cold months of the year. The first kind of episode was related to sea activity and the highest share of sea salt in aerosols (NaCl = 46.5\%). A second type of high PM10 concentration occurred at south-eastern advection when secondary aerosols, aging on the way from the source, were carried over Gdynia. In the spring of 2009, as a result of biomass combustion (fires and grass burning) in Ukraine and Southern Russia, the PM10 mass concentration climbed to 117.1 μg.m- 3 and was accompanied by substantial increases in nitrogen, sulphur and carbon compounds (reaching 32.5 μg.m- 3, 20.0 μg.m- 3, and 6.0 μg.m- 3, respectively). The third kind of high PM10 concentration was related to local sources, mostly within the communal sector, the harbour area and the transshipment base, and was the consequence of low dispersion of pollution at a wind speed of 1 m·s- 1. At such times there was a rapid increase of carbon compound concentrations (53.8\%). Elemental carbon, an air pollution indicator which originates from means of transport, had the highest proportion in such instances, reaching 15.8\% of the total PM10 mass concentration.},

The temperature was changed up to 2200 K for various levels of initial concentration of hydrocarbon and residence time, and how the experimental parameters affected the mean diameter of carbon aggregates was examined. The temperature increase in experiments led to reduction of the mean diameter of the carbon aggregates, whereas increase in the initial concentration of hydrocarbon or the residence time resulted in slightly lifting it. The mean diameter removed of temperature effects correlated well with the initial carbon atom mol concentration of hydrocarbon, N C , and this parameter was used to develop the experimental equations. This article presents three kinds of experimental equations, and the prediction accuracy was confirmed to be improved when accounting for increasing the experimental parameters.},

	abstract = {Reducing uncertainties associated with measurements of black carbon (BC) particles is critical for improved quantification of their impacts on climate and health. We compared BC measurements using a continuous soot-monitoring system (COSMOS) and a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP) to assess their uncertainties. We found that measurements by COSMOS and MAAP instruments correlate strongly to each other, and their hourly ratio showed minimal temporal variations, but the MAAP values were systematically higher by a factor of 1.56 ± 0.19 (1σ), based on simultaneous observations on Fukue, a remote island in Japan, for about a year. This factor was almost independent of the air mass origins and seasons. Measurements in central Tokyo for about 2 months also yielded a similar relationship, with a systematic difference factor of ∼1.8. It is likely that the systematic differences are caused by differences in the conditions/protocols in the thermal/optical BC determinations used for calibration of each optical instrument. Based on results from the COSMOS instrument calibrated using an elemental carbon and organic carbon analyzer with thermal/optical transmittance correction, the MAAP absorption cross section (6.6 m2 g−1) needs to be systematically increased to 10.3 m2 g−1 at 639 nm for Fukue when b abs values derived from the built-in software are used. Small temporal fluctuations in the ratios of MAAP-derived BC to COSMOS-derived BC were possibly caused by humidity effects and temporal variations in the optical properties of the measured particles. For MAAP, we also found that low filter-transmittance (0.2–0.5) could either increase or decrease the BC reading. The current best recommendations with the MAAP instrument are to use an increased cross section, to use data with high filter-transmittance ({\textgreater}0.5) only, and to control humidity.

We present a method to estimate aging time-scales using an aging criterion based on cloud condensation nuclei activation. The results show a separation into a daytime regime where condensation dominates and a nighttime regime where coagulation dominates. For the chosen urban plume scenario, depending on the supersaturation threshold, the values for the aging time-scales vary between 0.06 hours and 10 hours during the day, and between 6 hours and 20 hours during the night.},

The data were used to obtain different time averages of BC concentrations, and these averages were then used to assess the diurnal, seasonal, and annual variability of BC over the study region. Assessment of diurnal variations revealed a strong association between BC concentrations and vehicular traffic. Peaks in BC concentration were co-incident with the morning (0730 to 0830, LST) and late evening (1930 to 2030, LST) rush hour traffic. Additionally, diurnal variability in BC concentrations during major festivals (Diwali and Dushera during the months of October/November) revealed an increase in BC concentrations due to fireworks displays. Maximum half hourly BC concentrations during the festival days were as high as 79.8 μg m −3 . However, the high concentrations rapidly decayed suggesting that local meteorology during the festive season was favorable for aerosol dispersion. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model with BC as the dependent variable and meteorological parameters as independent variables was fitted. The variability in temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction accounted for about 49\% of the variability in measured BC concentrations. Conditional probability function (CPF) analysis was used to identify the geographical location of local source regions contributing to the effective BC measured (at 880 nm) at the receptor site. The east north-east (ENE) direction to the receptor was identified as a major source region. National highway (NH8) and two coal-fired thermal power stations (at Gandhinagar and Sabarmati) were located in the identified direction, suggesting that local traffic and power plant emissions were likely contributors to the measured BC.},

We observe that pollutant levels build up during the early morning hours under stable boundary layer conditions yet fall off quickly within 150 m downwind of the highway. An ARI soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) provided measurements of the size-resolved chemical composition of refractory black carbon (rBC) and the associated coating species. The average size distribution of the traffic related PM is characterized by a rBC mode centered at ∼100 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter, D va (rBC mass fraction ∼50\%). A second rBC mode (rBC mass fraction ∼5\%) more heavily coated with organic material is also observed at D va ∼500 nm. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses of the traffic-related PM indicates that rBC is mostly associated with hydrocarbon-like organic (HOA) PM. These results are discussed in the context of chemically resolved size distributions and PMF analysis results performed on the SP-AMS stationary data collected at the Queens College site. Finally, we report emission indices (EI) for both fleet-average conditions and single vehicles, including several New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) buses, sampled by the AML in “chase” mode during the study.

	abstract = {Atmospheric nanoparticles are a pollutant currently unregulated through ambient air quality standards. The aim of this chapter is to assess the environmental and health impacts of atmospheric nanoparticles in European environments. This chapter begins with the conventional information on the origin of atmospheric nanoparticles, followed by their physical and chemical characteristics. A brief overview of recently published review articles on this topic is then presented to guide those readers interested in exploring any specific aspect of nanoparticles in greater detail. A further section reports a summary of recently published studies on atmospheric nanoparticles in European cities. This covers a total of about 45 sampling locations in 30 different cities within 15 European countries for quantifying levels of roadside and urban background particle number concentrations (PNCs). Average PNCs at the reviewed roadside and urban background sites were found to be 3.82 ± 3.25 × 10 4 and 1.63 ± 0.82 × 10 4 cm −3 , respectively, giving a roadside to background PNC ratio of 2.4. Engineered nanoparticles are one of the key emerging categories of airborne nanoparticles, especially for the indoor environments. Their ambient concentrations may increase in future due to widespread use of nanotechnology integrated products. Evaluation of their sources and probable impacts on air quality and human health are briefly discussed in the following section. Respiratory deposition doses received by the public exposed to roadside PNCs in numerous European locations are then estimated. These were found to be in the 1.17–7.56 × 10 10 h −1 range over the studied roadside European locations. The following section discusses the potential framework for airborne nanoparticle regulations in Europe and, in addition, the existing control measures to limit nanoparticle emissions at source. The chapter finally concludes with a synthesis of the topic areas covered and highlights important areas for further work.},

Comparative analysis of different pairs of atmospheric PM element concentration data sets, measured in different regions of the Earth, revealed a stable linear (on a logarithmic scale) correlation, showing a power law increase of every atmospheric PM element mass and simultaneously the cause of this increase - fractal nature of atmospheric PM genesis. Within the framework of multifractal geometry we show that the mass (volume) distribution of atmospheric PM elemental components is a log normal distribution, which on a logarithmic scale with respect to the random variable (elemental component mass) is identical to normal distribution. This means that the parameters of two-dimensional normal distribution with respect to corresponding atmospheric PM-multifractal elemental components measured in different regions, are a priory connected by equations of direct and inverse linear regression, and the experimental manifestation of this fact is the linear correlation between the concentrations of the same elemental components in different sets of experimental atmospheric PM data.},

Sources of particulate matters include both natural and anthropogenic processes. The present work consists in determining the concentrations of existing elements in the aerosols collected in Andravoahangy and in Ambodin'Isotry in Antananarivo city (Madagascar). The size distribution of these elements and their main sources are also studied. The Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer is used for the qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results show that the concentrations of the airborne particulate matters PM2.5-10 are higher than those of PM2.5. The identified elements in the aerosol samples are Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Sr and Pb. The average concentrations of these elements are also higher in the coarse particles than in the fine particles. The calculation of the enrichment factors by Mason's model shows that Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br and Pb are of anthropogenic origins. The average concentrations of lead (2.8 ng.m-3, 31.3 ng.m-3 and 19.6 ng.m-3 respectively in aerosols collected in Andravoahangy in 2007 and in 2008 and in Ambodin'Isotry in 2008) are largely lower than the average concentration of 1.8 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}g.m-3 obtained in 2000 in the Antananarivo urban areas. The concentration of black carbon is higher in the fine particles. The Air Quality Index category is variable in the two sites.},

Suppression of low-level rainout and aerosol washout allows transport of water and smoke to upper levels, where the clouds appear "smoking" as they detrain much of the pollution. Elevating the onset of precipitation allows invigoration of the updrafts, causing intense thunderstorms, large hail, and greater likelihood for overshooting cloud tops into the stratosphere. There, detrained pollutants and water vapor would have profound radiative impacts on the climate system. The invigorated storms release the latent heat higher in the atmosphere. This should substantially affect the regional and global circulation systems. Together, these processes affect the water cycle, the pollution burden of the atmosphere, and the dynamics of atmospheric circulation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to characterize the emissions of a large number of chemical compounds emitted from birch wood combustion in a wood stove. Birch wood is widely used as fuel in Swedish household appliances. The fuel load was held constant during six experiments.
Particles {\textless}2.5 [mu]m in diameter were collected and the size distribution of the particles was measured. The results were compared to the size distribution in road traffic emissions. It could be seen that the number distribution differed between the sources. In traffic exhaust, the number of particles maximized at 20 nm, while the number distribution from wood burning ranged from 20 to 300 nm. The ratio K/Ca on particles was found to be significantly different in wood burning compared to road dust, range 30-330 for the former and 0.8±0.15 for the latter. The source profile of common elements emitted from wood burning differed from that found on particles at a street-level site or in long-distance transported particles.
The ratio toluene/benzene in this study was found to be in the range 0.2-0.7, which is much lower than the ratio 3.6±0.5 in traffic exhaust emissions.
Formaldehyde and acetone were the most abundant compounds among the volatile ketones and aldehydes. The emission factor varied between 180-710 mg/kg wood for formaldehyde and 5-1300 mg/kg wood for acetone. Of the organic acids analyzed (3,4,5)-trimethoxy benzoic acid was the most abundant compound. Of the PAHs reported, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene contribute to more than 70\% of the mass of PAH. Of the elements analyzed, K and Si were the most abundant elements, having emission factors of 27 and 9 mg/kg wood, respectively.
Although fluoranthene has a toxic equivalence factor of 5\% of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), it can be seen that the toxic potency of fluoranthene in wood burning emissions is of the same size as B(a)P. This indicates that the relative carcinogenic potency contribution of fluoranthene in wood smoke would be about 40\% of B(a)P.},

	abstract = {Measurements in a road tunnel in Stockholm, Sweden give the real-world traffic emission factors for a number of gaseous and particle pollutants. These include 49 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), CO, NOX, benzene, toluene, xylenes, aldehydes, elements and inorganic/organic carbon contained in particles, the sub-micrometer aerosol number size distribution, PM2.5 and PM10. The exhaust pipe emission factors are divided with the help of automated traffic counts into the two pollutant sources, the heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) and light-duty vehicles (LDV). The LDV fleet contains 95\% petrol cars and the total fleet contains about 5\% HDV. When data permitted, the emission factors were further calculated at different vehicle speeds. The current work shows that average CO, NOX and benzene emission factors amounted to 5.3, 1.4 and 0.017 g veh-1 km-1, respectively. Since the mid-90s CO and benzene decreased by about 15\%, carbonyls by about a factor 2, whereas NOX did not change much. PAH emission factors were 2-15 times higher than found during dynamometer tests. Most particles are distributed around 20 nm diameter and the LDV fleet contributes to about 65\% of both PM and particle number. In general, the gaseous emissions are higher in Sweden than in USA and Switzerland, foremost due to the lower fraction catalytic converters in Sweden. The PM and number emissions of particles are also slightly higher in the Swedish tunnel.},

At each location NO2 concentrations were measured during a period of 6 months with a sampling period of 1 month. The temporal and geographical variation of the model results compared with measurements was evaluated. Although the overall performance was satisfactory, the modelled concentrations were on average slightly higher than the measured concentrations. The agreement was better in the rural areas than in densely trafficked urban areas. Two different methods for estimation of the urban background are compared. It is shown that relatively simple methods for modelling traffic pollution can provide reasonable good results without excessive computing time. This is important when modelling is required for a large number of street locations.},

Spectral extinction coefficients were measured during the time period between September 1988 and January 1989 (mid-spring to mid-summer) and again from February 1990 to June 1990 (autumn to mid-winter). The measured data give a distinct daily pattern which on the average shows high values in the morning and a steady decrease in the afternoon. A similar pattern is found for the mass concentration of particulate matter but not for sulphur dioxide. The extinction coefficient in Santiago decreases generally with increasing wavelength; a satisfactory approximation for the wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient on the average is a power law with an Ångström exponent of [alpha] = 1.22. Measured extinction coefficients correlate well with mass concentration of suspended inhalable particulate matter. Mass extinction coefficients in Santiago are higher but comparable to other locations; a representative value of 5 m2 g-1 can be given. The measured extinction coefficients show strong statistical correlations with visibilities observed at three airports in and near Santiago. A comparison with atmospheric pollution indicators in other large cities shows that the daily pattern of variation of the extinction coefficient in Santiago de Chile is markedly different and that the values of the extinction coefficients and mass concentrations observed in Santiago are higher than or comparable to European and Asian cities. Pollutant dispersion from the Santiago air basin is dependent on thermal inversion phenomena, air pollution indicators being high in the morning and much lower in the afternoon.},

	abstract = {The light absorption coefficient of the aerosol of Santiago de Chile has been measured by means of the integrating plate method. Values ranging between 0.01 and 0.2 km-1 have been found. Variations of the absorption coefficient by a factor of 8 within a few hours have frequently been found and have their causes in the specific meteorology of the Santiago air basin. In the summer a minimum occurs between 1 and 4 a.m. and a maximum between 8 and 10 a.m., whereas in the winter a maximum is found during the night and minimum values are in the afternoon with a smaller amplitude. Similar variations of the light absorption coefficient have been found also inside uninhabited rooms, since the aerosol was transported there almost without any losses. The daily pattern is similar but delayed and has a lower mean value and amplitude.
When converting the light absorption to mass of black carbon, concentrations of elemental carbon of 1.3-25 [mu]g m-3 were obtained. This is similar to other large cities, where a considerable part of the mobile sources are equipped with diesel motors. The light absorption contributes to about 15\% of the light extinction of the aerosol, and considering an equal scattering of the soot particles, the contribution of soot to light attenuation in the atmosphere is about 30\%. The single scattering albedo of the aerosol is 0.85, thus the heating effect of the absorption dominates.
The light absorption coefficient is wavelength dependent with an average relationship of [sigma]a = k([lambda][lambda]0)-[alpha], the exponent being [alpha] = 0.92. The exponent of the wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient of the aerosol was 1.22.},

	abstract = {The primary objective was to characterize exhaust aerosols from a small group of in-use, light-duty, spark ignition (SI) vehicles operated on-road, and on a chassis dynamometer. A significant particle signature above background was not measured at highway cruise condition. Number emissions were much higher during acceleration, at high-speed cruise, and during cold-cold starts. Group average fuel-specific number emissions range from 3.9×1014 to 1.0×1017 particles/kg of fuel. Cold-cold start temperatures, driving cycles and vehicular condition influence SI emissions. Elemental carbon was a major contributor to mass emissions measured in chassis dynamometer Unified Driving Cycle (UDC) tests averaging 64\% and 34\% of the mass emissions for cold-cold and hot start cycles, respectively. Average ratios of cold-cold to hot start emissions were 3.3, 7.6, and 22 for CPC number, filter mass and SMPS volume, respectively. Apportionment results showed that on a weekly weighted basis and on weekdays, the majority of observed particle number was attributed to heavy-duty diesel traffic. Weekend production of particles was attributable to light-duty automobiles. On a per vehicle basis, heavy-duty vehicles produced substantially greater number concentrations. On a fuel-specific basis, heavy-duty vehicles produce slightly higher concentrations of particles than light-duty vehicles. The relative contribution of light-duty vehicles to particle number emissions increased as particle size decreased, for the smallest particles apportioned number emissions were 1.3×1016 and 7.1×1015 particles/kg of fuel for heavy-duty and light-duty vehicles, respectively. Comparison of on-road chase and apportionment results with chassis dynamometer tests in a certification type facility suggests that the latter may underestimate real-world number emissions.},

Combustion of biomass fuel can generate high levels of indoor air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This study characterized PM and VOC emissions from cow dung combustion in a controlled experiment. Dung from grass-fed cows was dried and combusted using a dual-cone calorimeter. Heat fluxes of 10, 25, and 50 kW/m2 were applied. The concentrations of PM and VOCs were determined using a dust spectrometer and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, respectively. PM and VOC emission factors were much higher for the lower heat flux, implying a fire ignition stage. When the heat flux was 50 kW/m2, the CO2 emission factor was highest and the PM and VOC emission factors were lowest. Particle concentrations were highest in the 0.23?0.3 ?m size range at heat fluxes of 25 and 50 kW/m2. Various toxic VOCs, including acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, benzene, and toluene, were detected at high concentrations. Although PM and VOC emission factors at 50 kW/m2 were lower, they were high enough to cause extremely high indoor air pollution. The characteristics of PM and VOC emissions from cow dung combustion indicated potential health effects of indoor air pollution in developing countries.},

The objective of this study was to assess the potential human health implications of the widespread use of biodiesel in Canada compared to those from ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD). The health impacts/benefits resulting from biodiesel use were determined with the Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool, based on output from the AURAMS air quality modeling system and the MOBILE6.2C on-road vehicle emissions model. Scenarios included runs for ULSD and biodiesel blends with 5 and 20\% of biodiesel by volume, and compared their use in 2006 and 2020. Although modeling and data limitations exist, the results of this study suggested that the use of biodiesel fuel blends compared to ULSD was expected to result in very minimal changes in air quality and health benefits/costs across Canada, and these were likely to diminish over time.},

	abstract = {Human exposure to particles depends on particle loss mechanisms such as deposition and filtration. Fine and ultrafine particles (FP and UFP) were measured continuously over seven consecutive days during summer and winter inside 74 homes in Edmonton, Canada. Daily average air exchange rates were also measured. FP were also measured outside each home and both FP and UFP were measured at a central monitoring station. A censoring algorithm was developed to identify indoor-generated concentrations, with the remainder representing particles infiltrating from outdoors. The resulting infiltration factors were employed to determine the continuously changing background of outdoor particles infiltrating the homes. Background-corrected indoor concentrations were then used to determine rates of removal of FP and UFP following peaks due to indoor sources. About 300 FP peaks and 400 UFP peaks had high-quality (median R2 value {\textgreater}98\%) exponential decay rates lasting from 30 min to 10 h. Median (interquartile range (IQR)) decay rates for UFP were 1.26 (0.82?1.83) h?1; for FP 1.08 (0.62?1.75) h?1. These total decay rates included, on average, about a 25\% contribution from air exchange, suggesting that deposition and filtration accounted for the major portion of particle loss mechanisms in these homes. Models presented here identify and quantify effects of several factors on total decay rates, such as window opening behavior, home age, use of central furnace fans and kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans, use of air cleaners, use of air conditioners, and indoor?outdoor temperature differences. These findings will help identify ways to reduce exposure and risk.},

Air pollution from the transport sector has a marked effect on human health, so isolating the pollutant contribution from a roadway is important in understanding its impact on the local neighbourhood. This paper proposes a novel technique based on a semi-empirical air pollution model to quantify the impact from a roadway on the air quality of a local neighbourhood using ambient records of a single air pollution monitor. We demonstrate the proposed technique using a case study, in which we quantify the contribution from a major highway with respect to the local background concentration in Auckland, New Zealand. Comparing the diurnal variation of the model-separated background contribution with real measurements from a site upwind of the highway shows that the model estimates are reliable. Amongst all of the pollutants considered, the best estimations of the background were achieved for nitrogen oxides. Although the multi-pronged approach worked well for predominantly vehicle-related pollutants, it could not be used effectively to isolate emissions of PM10 due to the complex and less predictable influence of natural sources (such as marine aerosols).

The proposed approach is useful in situations where ambient records from an upwind background station are not available (as required by other techniques) and is potentially transferable to situations such as intersections and arterial roads. Applying this technique to longer time series could help to understand the changes in pollutant concentrations from the road and background sources for different emission scenarios, for different years or seasons. Modelling results also show the potential of such a hybrid semi-empirical models to contribute to our understanding of the physical parameters determining air quality and to validate emissions inventory data.},

	abstract = {Soil erosion is a serious threat to agricultural productivity and the sustainable provision of food to a growing world population. No connection has hitherto been established between aerosols and rainfall-induced soil erosion on the ground. Here we use a cloud resolving model to simulate the effect of aerosols on rainfall erosivity (an indicator of the erosive potential of rain). Increased atmospheric aerosol concentrations tend to suppress precipitation in warm-rain clouds, while in cold or mixed-phase systems invigoration of surface rainfall can occur. We show that in both these cases the response of erosivity to an increase in aerosol is in the same direction as, but amplified beyond the change in total rainfall. We also show that aerosols can impact erosivity through changes in raindrop size. Our results suggest that anthropogenic aerosol emissions affect erosivity and thus may have important consequences for agricultural productivity.},

In particular, rapid narrow precipitation features termed precipitation bands have been hypothesized to be an integral contributor to relativistic electron precipitation loss but quantification of their net effect is still needed. Here we investigate precipitation bands as measured at low earth orbit by the CSSWE CubeSat. Two precipitation bands of MeV electrons were observed on Jan 18–19, 2013, concurrent with precipitation seen by the 2013 BARREL balloon campaign. The newly available conjugate measurements allow for a detailed estimate of the temporal and spatial features of precipitation bands for the first time. We estimate the net electron loss due to the precipitation bands and find that 20 such events could empty the entire outer belt. This study suggests that precipitation bands play a critical role in radiation belt losses.},

However, little is known about how urban areas vary in their capacity to address effectively air and water quality impacts associated to urban development. There exists a need to better understanding the factors that mediate the interactions between urbanisation and variations of environmental quality. By synthesizing literatures on the relationship between urban development and air and water quality, we assess the amount of scholarship for each of these cities, characterize population growth rates in one hundred of the largest global cities, and link growth trends to changes in air and water quality. Our results suggest that, while there is a growing literature linking urbanisation and environmental quality, some regions of the globe are better represented than others, and that these trends are consistent with our characterization of population growth rates. In addition, the comparison between population growth rates and air and water quality suggest that multiple factors affect the environmental quality, and that approaching rates of urbanisation through the lens of ‘resiliency’ can be an effective integrative concept for studying the capacity of urban areas to respond to rapid rates of change. Based on these results we offer a framework for systematically assessing changes in air and water quality in megacities.},

Using the three concrete case cities—New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenix—the article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of “system of cities” (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy.},

To assess determinants of variability in air pollutant concentrations, we develop land use regression (LUR) models for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particle number concentrations (UFPN). We used 136 h (39 sites), 112 h (26 sites), 147 h (39 sites) of PM2.5, BC, and UFPN data respectively, to develop separate morning (0800?1200) and afternoon (1200?1800) models. Continuous measurements of PM2.5 and BC were also made at a single fixed rooftop site located in a high-income residential neighborhood. No continuous measurements of UFPN were available. In addition to spatial variables, measurements from the fixed continuous monitoring site were used as independent variables in the PM2.5 and BC models. The median concentrations (and interquartile range) of PM2.5, BC, and UFPN at LUR sites were 133 (96?232) ?g m?3, 11 (6?21) ?g m?3, and 40 (27?72) ? 103 cm?3 respectively. In addition (a) for PM2.5 and BC, the temporal variability was higher than the spatial variability; (b) the magnitude and spatial variability in pollutant concentrations was higher during morning than during afternoon hours. Further, model R2 values were higher for morning (for PM2.5, BC, and UFPN, respectively: 0.85, 0.86, and 0.28) than for afternoon models (0.73, 0.69, and 0.23); (c) the PM2.5 and BC concentrations measured at LUR sites all over the city were strongly correlated with measured concentrations at a fixed rooftop site; (d) spatial patterns were similar for PM2.5 and BC but different for UFPN; (e) population density and road variables were statistically significant predictors of pollutant concentrations; and (f) available geographic predictors explained a much lower proportion of variability in measured PM2.5, BC, and UFPN than observed in other LUR studies, indicating the importance of temporal variability and suggesting the existence of uncharacterized sources.},

Here, we report winter intra-urban monitoring and land-use regression (LUR) results from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS). Two-week integrated samples of fine particles (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were collected at 155 city-wide street-level locations during winter 2008–2009. Sites were selected using stratified random sampling, randomized across sampling sessions to minimize spatio-temporal confounding. LUR was used to identify GIS-based source indicators associated with higher concentrations. Prediction surfaces were produced using kriging with external drift. Each pollutant varied twofold or more across sites, with higher concentrations near midtown Manhattan. All pollutants were positively correlated, particularly PM2.5 and BC (Spearman’s r=0.84). Density of oil-burning boilers, total and truck traffic density, and temporality explained 84\% of PM2.5 variation. Densities of total traffic, truck traffic, oil-burning boilers and industrial space, with temporality, explained 65\% of BC variation. Temporality, built space, bus route location, and traffic density described 67\% of nitrogen dioxide variation. Residual oil-burning units, nighttime population and temporality explained 77\% of SO2 variation. Spatial variation in combustion-related pollutants in New York City was strongly associated with oil-burning and traffic density. Chronic exposure disparities and unique local sources can be identified through year-round saturation monitoring.},

	abstract = {Abstract
During winter nights, topographically confined urban areas can experience episodes of particulate matter pollution as a result of combustion related emissions for domestic heating. Black carbon (BC) concentrations were measured vertically and temporally during winter evenings in four New Zealand urban locations as a proxy for combustion-related particulate matter (PM). Vertical temperature and BC profiles demonstrated the formation of inversion conditions, where the near-ground boundary layer becomes decoupled from layers above. The BC profiles indicated that PM was mostly confined to a surface layer less than 50 m in height from the surface. In addition, the BC concentrations exhibited a temporal pattern consistent with previously observed PM10 diurnal cycles, where maximum BC concentrations within the mixing height were observed near midnight. Decreasing BC concentrations during early morning were attributed to observed katabatic flows clearing the boundary layer. By dawn, BC concentrations in the vertical column were close to the much lower concentrations (\&lt;5 μg m−3) observed during the daytime, revealing that the observed night-time and morning peaks were separate events. Hence, the mid-morning peak is from new emissions due to residents re-lighting their fires. This study has contributed to our understanding of how meteorological conditions influence the build-up and dissipation of BC, and by extension, PM, during winter nights, which can result in significant air pollution events for our urban communities. Critically, the mid-morning peak can significantly contribute to exceedences of the 24-h air quality standard (50 μg m−3 PM10).},

The average particulate concentration attributed to motor vehicle emissions was found to correlate with the airshed population, whereas the home heating contribution was observed to be independent. It was found that particulate matter from biomass burning for home heating emissions often build up during cold calm nights under temperature inversion conditions, restricting vertical dispersion thus confining air particulate matter to a limited atmospheric volume. The average winter particulate concentrations due to home heating within the airsheds studied were attributed more to environmental confinement rather than source activity.},

Major water-soluble ions, black carbon (BC), and some elements in the samples were analysed, and the data compiled into two sets. Selected trace gases (NH3, HONO, HNO3, and SO2) were also collected at the same time. Application of positive matrix factorisation to the particle data resolved five sources for the fine particles and five for the coarse particles. Weighted multiple linear regression was used to investigate the mass contributions of the sources. It was found that although natural sources had significant contributions to the coarse particles, anthropogenic sources dominated the contributions to the fine particles, particularly in winter. Significant seasonal changes of the sources were observed. Overall, sea salt and wind-blown soil had significantly stronger contributions in the summer; in contrast, the winter contribution of vehicle emissions, road dust, and industry and incineration sources was significantly higher. These seasonal changes may be explained by variations in meteorological conditions and atmospheric chemistry. The nonparametric correlations between the atmospheric concentrations of the trace gases and the mass contributions of the resolved sources demonstrate that these sources are realistic, providing a useful supplementary approach for the assessment of receptor modelling.},

Emissions from motor vehicles have been one of the primary pollution sources in the metropolitan areas throughout Hong Kong for a long time. A 1-yr monitoring program for VOCs, PAHs and carbonyl compounds had been performed at a roadside urban station at Hong Kong Polytechnic University in order to determine the variations and correlations of each selected species (VOCs, PAHs and carbonyl compounds). This study is aimed to analyze toxic volatile organic compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene), two carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde), and selective polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The monitoring program started from 16 April 1999 to 30 March 2000. Ambient VOC concentrations, many of which originate from the same sources as particulate PAHs and carbonyls compounds, show significant quantities of benzene, toluene and xylenes. Correlations and multivariate analysis of selected gaseous and particulate phase organic pollutants were performed. Source identification by principle component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis allowed the identification of four sources (factors) for the roadside monitoring station. Factor 1 represents the effect of diesel vehicle exhaust. Factor 2 shows the contribution of aromatic compounds. Factor 3 explains photochemical products—formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Factor 4 explains the effect of gasoline vehicle exhaust.},

Specifically, the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Superfund Research Program (SRP) requires research centers to include research translation and community engagement cores to achieve broader impacts, with special emphasis on improving environmental health policies through better scientific understanding. This paper draws on theoretical insights from the social sciences to show how incorporating knowledge brokers in research centers can facilitate translation of scientific expertise to influence regulatory processes and thus promote public health. Knowledge brokers connect academic researchers with decision-makers, to facilitate the translation of research findings into policies and programs. In this article, we describe the stages of the regulatory process and highlight the role of the knowledge broker and scientific expert at each stage. We illustrate the cooperation of knowledge brokers, scientific experts and policymakers using a case from the Brown University (Brown) SRP. We show how the Brown SRP incorporated knowledge brokers to engage scientific experts with regulatory officials around the emerging public health problem of vapor intrusion (VI). In the Brown SRP, the knowledge broker brought regulatory officials into the research process, to help scientific experts understand the critical nature of this emerging public health threat, and helped scientific experts develop a research agenda that would inform the development of timely measures to protect public health. Our experience shows that knowledge brokers can enhance the impact of environmental research on public health by connecting policy decision-makers with scientific experts at critical points throughout the regulatory process.},

The unit cost of pollutant reduction (UCPR) was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of each emission reduction measure. The marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves for SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and CO2 were drawn based on the UCPR and the abatement potential. Air pollutant equivalence (APeq) captures the nature of the damage value-weights of various air pollutants and acts as uniformization multiple air pollutants index. Single pollutant abatement routes designed in accordance with the corresponding reduction targets revealed that the cocontrol strategy has promising potential. Moreover, with the same reduction cost limitations as the single pollutant abatement routes, the multipollutant cocontrol routes are able to obtain more desirable pollution reduction and health benefits. Co-control strategy generally shows cost-effective advantage over single-pollutant abatement strategy. The results are robust to changing parameters according to sensitivity analysis. Co-control strategy would be an important step to achieve energy/carbon intensity targets and pollution control targets in China. Though cocontrol strategy has got some traction in policy debates, there are barriers to integrate it into policy making in the near future in China.},

Recent research suggests that benign implications also exist for the environment in the sense that investing more in social policies may contribute to stronger environmental protection and higher environmental quality. We present theoretical arguments in favor, but also against this hypothesis, and evaluate it empirically with cross-sectional data for 68 countries. In contrast to previous studies, the results offer only weak and inconsistent support for the claim that social policies and environmental performance are systematically related. This means that governments of economically kinder, gentler societies would be ill advised to hope for positive ?spillover effects? of social policies into the environmental realm. The findings also suggest, however, that more disaggregated analyses are necessary, since beneficial effects may exist in some environmental domains, but not in others.},

The data provides a climatology of BC in the remote regions that reveals gradients of BC concentration reflecting global scale transport and removal of pollution. BC is identified as a sensitive tracer of extra-tropical mixing into the lower tropical tropopause layer, and trends toward surprisingly uniform loadings in the lower stratosphere of 1 ng/kg. The climatology is compared to predictions from the AeroCom global model intercomparison initiative. The AeroCom model suite overestimates loads in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere ( 10X) more severely than at lower altitudes ( 3X), with bias roughly independent of season or geographic location; these results indicate that it overestimates BC lifetime.},

The ensemble comprises eight members resulting from combining two options of parameterization schemes for the planetary boundary layer, cumulus and microphysics. The differences in the ensemble members (spread) for the concentration of tropospheric ozone and PM10 are strongly affected by the physics selected, and could be considered as a matter of uncertainty in the change signals.

Climate controls many of these natural aerosol sources, which in turn can alter climate through changing the properties of clouds and the Earth's radiative balance. However, the Earth's atmosphere is now heavily modified by anthropogenic pollution aerosol, but how this pollution may alter these natural aerosol - climate feedbacks has not been previously explored. Here we use a global aerosol microphysics model to analyze how anthropogenic aerosol alters one link within these feedbacks, namely the sensitivity of cloud albedo to changes in natural aerosol. We demonstrate that anthropogenic aerosol in the Northern Hemisphere has halved the hemispheric mean cloud albedo radiative effect that occurs due to changes in natural aerosol emissions. Such a suppression has not occurred in the more pristine Southern Hemisphere.},

	abstract = {Debate about the biological effects of biodiesel exhaust emissions exists due to variation in methods of exhaust generation and biological models used to assess responses. Because studies in cells do not necessarily reflect the integrated response of a whole animal, experiments were conducted in two human cell lines representing bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages and female mice using identical particle suspensions of raw exhaust generated by a Volkswagen light-duty diesel engine using petrodiesel (B0) and a biodiesel blend (B20: 20\% soy biodiesel/80\% B0 by volume). Tailpipe particle emissions measurement showed B0 generated two times more particle mass, larger ultrafine particle number distribution modes, and particles of more nonpolar organic composition than the B20 fuel. Biological assays (inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress biomarkers) demonstrated that particulate matter (PM) generated by combustion of the two fuels induced different responses in in vitro and in vivo models. Concentrations of inflammatory mediators (Interleukin-6, IL-6; Interferon-gamma-induced Protein 10, IP-10; Granulocyte-stimulating factor, G-CSF) in the medium of B20-treated cells and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice exposed to B20 were ?20?30\% higher than control or B0 PM, suggesting that addition of biodiesel to diesel fuels will reduce PM emissions but not necessarily adverse health outcomes.},

Three decades of reliable, high temporal-resolution observations of coupled ocean-atmosphere variability in the equatorial Pacific reveal a rich diversity of El Niños. Although central and eastern Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies appear mechanistically separable in terms of local and remote forcing, their frequent overlap precludes robust classifications. All observed El Niños appear to be a mixture of locally (central Pacific) and remotely forced (eastern Pacific) SST anomalies. Submonthly resolution appears essential for this insight and for the proper dynamical diagnosis of El Niño evolution; thus, the use of long-term monthly reconstructions for classification and trend analysis is strongly cautioned against.},

This paper examines trip related factors that affect the potential of active transport modes. The paper reports on the results of a long-term travel survey where daily activity-car travel patterns were automatically monitored for a cohort of people. Analysis of the results demonstrates that 64\% of all monitored car trips were shorter than 8 km and can thus theoretically be replaced by active transport modes. After taking into account trip related criteria that may hamper substitution of car trips by active forms of transport, only 9.5\% of the monitored trips can still be walked or cycled. If all of these remaining trips were substituted by non-motorized modes, this would correspond to approximately 2\% of the travelled distance and 3\% of the fuel consumption.},

In 2011, the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) inventory of diffuse emissions became available, providing data on a range of atmospheric emissions at a 5 km resolution across Europe. The data are produced from spatially disaggregated emissions totals for countries, and must be validated before being used at a sub-national level. The UK government maintains a 1 km resolution emissions inventory based on a bottom-up methodology by which a validation is possible. The UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory data are used to assess at what geographic scale the new E-PRTR data might be most useful. This paper compares the two data sets and estimates city-level transportation CO2 emissions for 149 EU cities. We find that at a functional boundary level the two datasets match well.},

This is true for several reasons such as the distribution of other pollution sources and regional topology, as well as meteorology. In this paper, using a dataset from a travel demand model for the Sacramento metropolitan area for 2005, regional vehicle emissions are disaggregated into hourly, gridded emission inventories, and transportation-related concentrations are estimated using an atmospheric dispersion model. Contributions of on-road motor vehicles to urban air pollution are then identified at a regional scale. The contributions to ambient concentrations are slightly higher than emission fractions that transportation accounts for in the region, reflecting that relative to other major pollution sources, mobile sources tend to have a close proximity to air quality monitors in urban areas. The contribution results indicate that the impact of mobile sources on PM10 is not negligible, and mobile sources have a significant influence on both NOx and VOC pollution that subsequently results in secondary particulate matter and ozone formation.},

To resolve the situation, Federal Highway Administration entered into a Settlement Agreement with Nevada DOT and the Sierra Club, wherein the Administration agreed to undertake a research effort to characterize the impact and behavior of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm and mobile source air toxics near highways. The US Federal Highway Administration and US Environmental Protection Agency determined that it would be in the best interest of both organizations to implement this project in a collaborative manner, allowing a more effective utilization of staffing and resources. One of the first steps of the project implementation has been the selection of a suitable ambient air monitoring site in or around Las Vegas, Nevada.

The specific aspects of the built environment that influence vehicle choice, however, have not been well-established. Further, these studies have not shed much light on the underlying direction of causality: whether neighborhood designs themselves, as opposed to preferences for neighborhood characteristics or attitudes towards travel, more strongly influence individuals’ decisions regarding vehicle type. Using a sample from Northern California, this study investigated the relationship between neighborhood design and vehicle type choice, controlling for residential self-selection. Correlation analyses showed that neighborhood design has a strong association with vehicle type choice. Specifically, traditional neighborhood designs are correlated with the choice of passenger cars, while suburban designs are associated with the choice of light duty trucks. The nested logit model suggests that sociodemographic and attitudinal factors play an important role, and that an outdoor spaciousness measure (based on perceptions of yard sizes and off-street parking availability) and commute distance also impact vehicle type choice after controlling for those other influences. This study, therefore, supports the premise that land use policies have at least some potential to reduce the choice of light duty trucks, thereby reducing emissions.},

The highest concentrations were measured when occupants were present and awake (geometric mean, GM: 22.3 ? 103 cm?3), the lowest when the homes were vacant (GM: 6.1 ? 103 cm?3) or the occupants were asleep (GM: 5.1 ? 103 cm?3). Diary entries regarding occupancy and particle related activities were used to identify source events and apportion the daily integrated exposure among sources. Source events clearly resulted in increased PN concentrations and decreased average particle diameter. For a given event, elevated particle concentrations persisted for several hours after the emission of fresh particles ceased. The residential daily integrated PN exposure in the 56 homes ranged between 37 ? 103 and 6.0 ? 106 particles per cm3·h/day (GM: 3.3 ? 105 cm?3·h/day). On average, ?90\% of this exposure occurred outside of the period from midnight to 6 a.m. Source events, especially candle burning, cooking, toasting, and unknown activities, were responsible on average for ?65\% of the residential integrated exposure (51\% without the unknown activities). Candle burning occurred in half of the homes where, on average, it was responsible for almost 60\% of the integrated exposure.},

	abstract = {From 19 April to 19 May 2010, volcanic aerosol layers originating from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano were observed at the CNR-IMAA Atmospheric Observatory, named CIAO (40.60 N, 15.72 E, 760 m a.s.l), in Southern Italy with a multi-wavelength Raman lidar. During this period, ultragiant aerosols were also observed at CIAO using a co-located 8.45-mm wavelength Doppler radar. The Ka-band radar observed in four separate days (19 April and 7, 10, and 13 May) signatures consistent with the observation of non-spherical ultragiant aerosols characterized by values of linear depolarization ratio (LDR) higher than -4 dB. Air mass backtrajectory analysis suggests a volcanic origin of the ultragiant aerosols observed by the radar. The observed values of the radar reflectivity (Ze) are consistent with a particle effective radius (r) larger than 50-75 µm. Scattering simulations based on the T-matrix approach show that the high LDR values can be explained if the observed particles have an absolute aspect ratio larger than 3.0 and consist of an internal aerosol core and external ice shell, with a variable radius ratio ranging between 0.2 and 0.7 depending on the shape and aspect ratio. Comparisons between daytime vertical profiles of aerosol backscatter coefficient (β) as measured by lidar and radar LDR reveal a decrease of β where ultragiant particles are observed. Scattering simulations based on Mie theory show how the lidar capability in typing ultragiant aerosols could be limited by low number concentrations or by the presence of an external ice shell covering the aerosol particles. Preferential vertical alignment of the particles is discussed as another possible reason for the decrease of β.},

The coupled model was evaluated against available observational data from a sensor network and flux tower. The effects of land use type and anthropogenic heat (AH) on the thermal and wind environment were investigated with a series of sensitivity tests using an ensemble approach for low advection, high convective available potential energy (CAPE), inter-monsoon season cases. The diurnal cycle and spatial pattern of urban heat island (UHI) intensity and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height were investigated. The mean UHI intensity peaked in the early morning at 2.2 °C, reaching 2.4 °C in industrial areas. Sea and land breezes developed during daytime and nighttime, respectively, with the former much stronger than the latter. The model predicted that sea breezes from different coastlines of the Malay Peninsula meet and converge, inducing strong updrafts. AH was found to play roles in all the processes studied, while the effect of different land use types was most pronounced during nighttime, and least visible near noon.},

	abstract = {Ocean-going vessels burning high-sulfur heavy fuel oil are an important source of air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Beginning in July 2009, an emission control area was put into effect at ports and along the California coastline, requiring use of lower sulfur fuels in place of heavy fuel oil in main engines of ships. To assess impacts of the fuel changes on air quality at the Port of Oakland and in the surrounding San Francisco Bay area, we analyzed speciated fine particle concentration data from four urban sites and two more remote sites. Measured changes in concentrations of vanadium, a specific marker for heavy fuel oil combustion, are related to overall changes in aerosol emissions from ships. We found a substantial reduction in vanadium concentrations after the fuel change and a 28?72\% decrease in SO2 concentrations, with the SO2 decrease varying depending on proximity to shipping lanes. We estimate that the changes in ship fuel reduced ambient PM2.5 mass concentrations at urban sites in the Bay area by about 3.1 ± 0.6\% or 0.28 ± 0.05 ?g/m3. The largest contributing factor to lower PM mass concentrations was reductions in particulate sulfate. Absolute sulfate reductions were fairly consistent across sites, whereas trace metal reductions were largest at a monitoring site in West Oakland near the port.},

	abstract = {The aerosol products retrieved using the MODIS collection 5.1 Deep Blue algorithm have provided useful information about aerosol properties over bright-reflecting land surfaces, such as desert, semi-arid, and urban regions. However, many components of the C5.1 retrieval algorithm needed to be improved; for example, the use of a static surface database to estimate surface reflectances. This is particularly important over regions of mixed vegetated and non-vegetated surfaces, which may undergo strong seasonal changes in land cover. In order to address this issue, we develop a hybrid approach, which takes advantage of the combination of pre-calculated surface reflectance database and normalized difference vegetation index in determining the surface reflectance for aerosol retrievals. As a result, the spatial coverage of aerosol data generated by the enhanced Deep Blue algorithm has been extended from the arid and semi-arid regions to the entire land areas. In this paper, the changes made in the enhanced Deep Blue algorithm regarding the surface reflectance estimation, aerosol model selection, and cloud screening schemes for producing the MODIS collection 6 aerosol products are discussed. A similar approach has also been applied to the algorithm that generates the SeaWiFS Deep Blue products. Based upon our preliminary results of comparing the enhanced Deep Blue aerosol products with the AERONET measurements, the expected error of the Deep Blue aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is estimated to be better than 0.05 + 20\%. Using 10 AERONET sites with long-term time series, 79\% of the best-quality Deep Blue AOT values are found to fall within this expected error.},

	abstract = {The limited understanding of black carbon (BC) aerosol emissions from incomplete combustion causes a poorly constrained anthropogenic climate warming that globally may be second only to CO2 and regionally, such as over East Asia, the dominant driver of climate change. The relative contribution to atmospheric BC from fossil fuel versus biomass combustion is important to constrain as fossil BC is a stronger climate forcer. The source apportionment is the underpinning for targeted mitigation actions. However, technology-based ?bottom-up? emission inventories are inconclusive, largely due to uncertain BC emission factors from small-scale/household combustion and open burning. We use ?top-down? radiocarbon measurements of atmospheric BC from five sites including three city sites and two regional sites to determine that fossil fuel combustion produces 80 ± 6\% of the BC emitted from China. This source-diagnostic radiocarbon signal in the ambient aerosol over East Asia establishes a much larger role for fossil fuel combustion than suggested by all 15 BC emission inventory models, including one with monthly resolution. Our results suggest that current climate modeling should refine both BC emission strength and consider the stronger radiative absorption associated with fossil-fuel-derived BC. To mitigate near-term climate effects and improve air quality in East Asia, activities such as residential coal combustion and city traffic should be targeted.},

We examine the net direct plus indirect radiative forcing caused by carbonaceous aerosol and sulfur emissions in key sectors of China and India, using the GISS-E2 chemistry–climate model. Diesel trucks and buses (67 mW m-2) and residential biofuel combustion (52 mW m-2) in India have the largest global-mean, annual-average forcings due mainly to the direct and indirect effects of BC. Emissions from these two sectors in China have near-zero net global forcings. Coal-fired power plants in both countries exert a negative forcing of about −30 mW m-2 from production of sulfate. Aerosol forcings are largest locally, with direct forcings due to residential biofuel combustion of 580 mW m-2 over India and 416 mW m-2 over China, but they extend as far as North America, Europe, and the Arctic.},

	abstract = {Environmental implications of fleet electrification highly depend on the adoption and utilization of electric vehicles at the individual level. Past research has been constrained by using aggregated data to assume all vehicles with the same travel pattern as the aggregated average. This neglects the inherent heterogeneity of individual travel behaviors and may lead to unrealistic estimation of environmental impacts of fleet electrification. Using ?big data? mining techniques, this research examines real-time vehicle trajectory data for 10,375 taxis in Beijing in one week to characterize the travel patterns of individual taxis. We then evaluate the impact of adopting plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) in the taxi fleet on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions based on the characterized individual travel patterns. The results indicate that 1) the largest gasoline displacement (1.1 million gallons per year) can be achieved by adopting PHEVs with modest electric range (approximately 80 miles) with current battery cost, limited public charging infrastructure, and no government subsidy; 2) reducing battery cost has the largest impact on increasing the electrification rate of vehicle mileage traveled (VMT), thus increasing gasoline displacement, followed by diversified charging opportunities; 3) government subsidies can be more effective to increase the VMT electrification rate and gasoline displacement if targeted to PHEVs with modest electric ranges (80 to 120 miles); and 4) while taxi fleet electrification can increase greenhouse gas emissions by up to 115 kiloton CO2-eq per year with the current grid in Beijing, emission reduction of up to 36.5 kiloton CO2-eq per year can be achieved if the fuel cycle emission factor of electricity can be reduced to 168.7 g/km. Although the results are based on a specific public fleet, this study demonstrates the benefit of using large-scale individual-based trajectory data (big data) to better understand environmental implications of fleet electrification and inform better decision making.},

Estimation of these exposures requires measurements or prediction of roadway concentrations. Our study develops, compares, and evaluates linear regression and nonlinear generalized additive models (GAMs) to estimate on-road concentrations of four key air pollutants, particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PB-PAH), particle number count (PNC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter with diameter {\textless}2.5 ?m (PM2.5) using traffic, meteorology, and elevation variables. Critical predictors included wind speed and direction for all the pollutants, traffic-related variables for PB-PAH, PNC, and NOx, and air temperatures and relative humidity for PM2.5. GAMs explained 50\%, 55\%, 46\%, and 71\% of the variance for log or square-root transformed concentrations of PB-PAH, PNC, NOx, and PM2.5, respectively, an improvement of 5\% to over 15\% over the linear models. Accounting for temporal autocorrelation in the GAMs further improved the prediction, explaining 57?89\% of the variance. We concluded that traffic and meteorological data are good predictors in estimating on-road traffic-related air pollutant concentrations and GAMs perform better for nonlinear variables, such as meteorological parameters.},

The BC and BrC emission factors ranged from 1.2 to 2.1 g/kg biomass and 1.0 to 1.4 g/kg biomass, respectively. A decrease in BC and BrC emission factors with decreased combustion efficiency was found from both field and laboratory data. VOC emission factors increased with decreased combustion efficiency.

They are indispensable to study the urban heat island effect and the adverse effects of high temperatures on human health. However, the availability of temperature observations in cities is often limited. Here we show that relatively accurate air temperature information for the urban canopy layer can be obtained from an alternative, nowadays omnipresent source: smartphones. In this study, battery temperatures were collected by an Android application for smartphones. A straightforward heat transfer model is employed to estimate daily mean air temperatures from smartphone battery temperatures for eight major cities around the world. The results demonstrate the enormous potential of this crowdsourcing application for real-time temperature monitoring in densely populated areas.},

	abstract = {As major air pollutants and key precursors of several secondary air pollutants, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are regulated in many countries. However, NOx control increases ozone concentrations when the ozone formation regime is volatile organic compound (VOC) limited. Although many studies have shown that NOx regulation reduces ozone levels over the long term, it is still of concern that NOx regulation increases short-term ozone levels in metropolitan regions, where ozone formation is found to be predominantly VOC-limited. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China is such a region. Our modeling sensitivity study shows that while NOx reduction in the PRD region may raise the mean ozone concentration, but it can also decrease peak ozone levels. Similar changes are observed in the NOx and ozone data of the PRD regional air quality monitoring network (2006–2012), lending further credence to our results. In the model, this NOx control effect is a result of the complicated spatial and diurnal variations of the ozone formation regime. In most of the PRD region, the formation regime is VOC-limited in the morning, and becomes NOx-limited during peak ozone hours. Although some areas are always VOC-limited, their ozone concentrations are relatively low, and the ozone increases caused by NOx reduction generally do not cause higher ozone levels than the region's original ozone maxima. Several control scenarios are simulated to evaluate the effects of various possible control regulations. Our results show that in addition to VOC control, NOx control can be effective for reducing peak ozone concentrations in the PRD region.},

Results over nine cities of the Northern Hemisphere for the period 2008-2011 show a typical seasonal behavior of tropospheric O3, with a first maximum reached in late spring because of stratospheric intrusion mainly, and a continuous rise till the summer because of the anthropogenic based ozone production. Over the East Asian cities, a decrease in the O3 tropospheric column is detected during monsoon period. Seasonal cycling of tropospheric NO2 shows consistent higher values during winter because of the higher anthropogenic sources and longer lifetime. In rural regions, a complex relation between the O3 and NO2 column is found, with good correlation in summer and winter. O3 concentrations in rural sites are found to be comparable to those closest to the anthropogenic emission sources, with peak values in spring and summer. Furthermore, the effect of the reduction of pollutant emissions in Beijing region during the Olympic games of 2008 compared to the same summer period in the following three years is studied. GOME-2 NO2 measurements show a reduction up to 54\% above Beijing during this period compared to the following three years. IASI O3 measurements show an increase of 12\% during July 2008 followed by a decrease of 5-6\% during the months of August and September.},

In this study, the agreement of LUR models with measured personal exposure was assessed. The measured components were particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 ?m (PM2.5), soot (reflectance of PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In Helsinki, Utrecht, and Barcelona, 15 volunteers (from semiurban, urban background, and traffic sites) followed prescribed time activity patterns. Per participant, six 96 h outdoor, indoor, and personal measurements spread over three seasons were conducted. Soot LUR models were significantly correlated with measured average outdoor and personal soot concentrations. Soot LUR models explained 39\%, 44\%, and 20\% of personal exposure variability (R2) in Helsinki, Utrecht, and Barcelona. NO2 LUR models significantly predicted outdoor concentrations and personal exposure in Utrecht and Helsinki, whereas NOx and PM2.5 LUR models did not predict personal exposure. PM2.5, NO2, and NOx models were correlated with personal soot, the component least affected by indoor sources. LUR modeled and measured outdoor, indoor, and personal concentrations were highly correlated for all pollutants when data from the three cities were combined. This study supports the use of intraurban LUR models for especially soot in air pollution epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Aircraft black carbon (BC) emissions contribute to climate forcing, but few estimates of BC emitted by aircraft at cruise exist. For the majority of aircraft engines the only BC-related measurement available is smoke number (SN)?a filter based optical method designed to measure near-ground plume visibility, not mass. While the first order approximation (FOA3) technique has been developed to estimate BC mass emissions normalized by fuel burn [EI(BC)] from SN, it is shown that it underestimates EI(BC) by {\textgreater}90\% in 35\% of directly measured cases (R2 = ?0.10). As there are no plans to measure BC emissions from all existing certified engines?which will be in service for several decades?it is necessary to estimate EI(BC) for existing aircraft on the ground and at cruise. An alternative method, called FOX, that is independent of the SN is developed to estimate BC emissions. Estimates of EI(BC) at ground level are significantly improved (R2 = 0.68), whereas estimates at cruise are within 30\% of measurements. Implementing this approach for global civil aviation estimated aircraft BC emissions are revised upward by a factor of ?3. Direct radiative forcing (RF) due to aviation BC emissions is estimated to be ?9.5 mW/m2, equivalent to ?1/3 of the current RF due to aviation CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {Significant uncertainty exists in the seasonal distribution of NH3 emissions since the predominant sources are animal husbandry and fertilizer application. Previous studies that estimated bottom-up and top-down NH3 emissions have provided the most comprehensive information available about the seasonality of NH3 emissions. In this study, this bottom-up and top-down emission information is combined with the most recent 2001 USEPA National Emission Inventory (NEI) to construct a best prior estimate of seasonal NH3 emissions. These emission estimates are then used in an annual 2001 USEPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulation for the continental United States. A key objective of this study is to evaluate these prior NH3 emission estimates and test the top-down inverse modeling method for a different year and a larger modeling domain than used previously. Based on the final posterior NH3 emission estimates, the inverse modeling results suggest that the annual total NEI NH3 emissions are reasonable and that a previous high bias in older USEPA emission inventories has been addressed in the updated inventory. Inverse modeling results suggest that the prior NH3 emission estimates should be increased in the summer and decreased in the winter, while results for the spring and fall are questionable due to precipitation prediction biases. A final conclusion from this study is that total NHx (NH3 and aerosol NH4+) air concentration data are essential for quantitative top-down analyses of NH3 emissions that can extend beyond what is possible using precipitation chemistry data.},

	abstract = {In urban areas, a large fraction of the population typically lives within 1.5 – 2 km of a freeway. In an earlier study, Hu et al. (2009) showed that in the pre-sunrise hours, with stable, nocturnal meteorological conditions, the vehicle-related pollution from a freeway in southern California extended more than 2 km downwind. This was in striking contrast to earlier studies in the U.S. and Australia showing that during the daytime pollutant concentrations extended no more than ∼300 m downwind of major roadways. The present study was designed to explore the variability of the large downwind pollutant impact zone observed by Hu et al. (2009) in the pre-sunrise hours on a wider geographic scale. An instrumented mobile platform was employed to measure vehicle-related pollutant concentrations on transects running upwind and downwind of four freeways in the coastal, central and eastern areas of the California South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) during the pre-sunrise period (04:30-06:30). Extended freeway plumes were observed for ultrafine particles (UFP), nitric oxide and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), at all four sites during stable pre-sunrise periods. Plume lengths were measured to be ∼2 km or more with a dilution rate coefficient about a factor of ten lower than commonly observed for daytime. An average of 39 and 19\% (±8–9\%) of freeway plume peak concentrations of UFP, respectively remained 500 and 1500 m downwind from the freeways for the four transects studied here. Because a large fraction of UFP and other vehicle related pollutants typically penetrate into indoor environments, and nocturnal surface inversions are widespread across the globe, our findings have significant implications for more extensive human exposures to vehicle-related pollutants than previously indicated based on daytime measurements of roadway plumes.},

	abstract = {This work provides the first automated mineralogical/phase assessment of urban airborne PM10 and a new method for determining particle surface mineralogy (PSM), which is a major control on PM toxicity in the lung. PM10 was analyzed on a TEOM filter (Aug.?Sept. 2006 collection) from the London Air Quality Network Bexley, East London, U.K. A cross-section of the filter was analyzed using a QEMSCAN automated mineralogical analysis system which provided 381?981 points of analysis for 14?525 particles over a period of 9 h 54 min. The method had a detection limit for individual mineral components of 0.05 ppm (by area). Particle shape and mineralogical characteristics were determined for particles in the size ranges PM10?4, PM4?2.5, and PM2.5?0.8. The PM2.5?0.8 fraction contained 2 orders of magnitude more mineral particles than the PM10?4 and PM4?2.5 fractions, however the PM10?4 fraction forms 94\% and 79\% of the mineral mass and surface area, respectively. PSM of the PM10 was dominated by gypsum (36\%), plagioclase (16\%), Na sulphates (8\%), and Fe?S?O phases (8\%) in the PM10?2.5, which may be important in explaining the toxicity of the coarse fraction. The wider implications of the study are discussed.},

	abstract = {Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is a chlorine atom source and reactive nitrogen reservoir formed during the night by heterogeneous reactions of dinitrogen pentoxide on chloride-containing aerosol particles. The main factors that influence ClNO2 production include nitrogen oxides, ozone, aerosol surface area, soluble chloride and ambient relative humidity. Regions with strong anthropogenic activity therefore have large ClNO2 formation potential, even inland of coastal regions due to transport or local emissions of soluble chloride. As part of the NACHTT field study, we report wintertime vertically resolved ClNO2 and Cl2 measurements taken on a 300 meter tall tower located at NOAA's Boulder Atmospheric Observatory in Weld County, CO, during February and March of 2011. Gas and particle phase measurements aboard the tower carriage allowed for a detailed description of the chemical state of the nocturnal atmosphere as a function of height. These observations show significant vertical structure in ClNO2 and Cl2 mixing ratios that undergo dynamic changes over the course of a night. Using these measurements we focus on two distinct combustion plume events where ClNO2 mixing ratios reached 600 and 1300 pptv, respectively, aloft of the nocturnal surface layer. We infer ClNO2 yields from N2O5-aerosol reactions using both observational constraints and box modeling. The derived yields in these plumes suggest efficient ClNO2 production compared to the campaign average, where in-plume yields range from 0.3 – 1, the campaign average yield in the boundary layer is 0.05 ± 0.15, with substantial night-to-night and within night variability similar to previous measurements in this region.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin of fine particulate matter is essential to proposing proper strategies for heavy haze mitigation in Shanghai, China. In this study we used the Particulate Matter Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) in CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) to quantify the impacts of emissions on the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its important components in Shanghai during heavy haze episodes in late autumn (November 06-22 2010). The factors considered here are regions of Shanghai and its surrounding areas, long range regional transport and different local emission categories. The results indicate that industrial process is the dominant local contributor to total PM2.5 mass in the whole city except that at the urban center vehicle emission contributes slightly more. In addition, industrial process and vehicle emission are the major local contributors for nitrate in Shanghai, although at urban core the contribution from vehicle emission is remarkably larger. Generally, both local contribution and regional transport contribution could dominate a severe haze event in late autumn. However, the dominant contributor could either be local emission or regional transport, usually depending on the meteorological conditions. Therefore, particular attentions should be paid to the emission control in the upwind adjacent provinces, as well as in local areas, for developing effective strategies to reduce PM2.5 pollution in Shanghai.},

The impact of this directive on air quality in some Mediterranean harbours was investigated based on observations made from August to October 2009 and 2010 at a monitoring station placed on a cruise ship, Costa Pacifica, following a fixed weekly route in the Western Mediterranean. The concentrations of SO2 were found to decrease significantly from 2009 to 2010 in three out of the four EU harbours; the average decrease of the daily mean concentrations in the different harbours was 66\%. The decrease of SO2 was not statistically significant in the harbour of Barcelona because of large day-to-day variations, however measurements from monitoring stations in the harbour zone of Barcelona as well as downwind of the harbour of Palma de Mallorca confirm a strong decrease in the SO2 concentrations from 2009 to 2010. No decrease was observed in the non-EU harbour of Tunis. Neither NOx nor BC concentrations showed significant changes in any of the harbours.},

In a random sample of Viennese inns (restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs and discotheques) effects of partial smoking bans on indoor air quality were examined by measurement of count, size and chargeable surface of ultrafine particles (UFPs) sized 10–300 nm, simultaneously with mass of particles sized 300–2500 nm (PM2.5). Air samples were taken in 134 rooms unannounced during busy hours and analyzed by a diffusion size classifier and an optical particle counter. Highest number concentrations of particles were found in smoking venues and smoking rooms (median 66,011 pt/cm3). Even non-smoking rooms adjacent to smoking rooms were highly contaminated (median 25,973 pt/cm3), compared with non-smoking venues (median 7,408 pt/cm3). The particle number concentration was significantly correlated with the fine particle mass (P{\textless}0.001). We conclude that the existing tobacco law in Austria is ineffective to protect customers in non-smoking rooms of hospitality premises. Health protection of non-smoking guests and employees from risky UFP concentration is insufficient, even in rooms labeled “non-smoking”. Partial smoking bans with separation of smoking rooms failed.},

During our research period, the mean daily concentrations of black carbon and PM2.5 were 3.9 μg/m3 and 53.9 μg/m3, respectively. The regression results showed that black carbon was significantly associated with total and cardiovascular mortality, but not with respiratory mortality. An inter-quartile range increase (2.7 μg/m3) of black carbon corresponded to a 2.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6–4.1), 3.2\% (95\% CI: 0.6–5.7), and 0.6\% (95\% CI: −4.5 to 5.7) increase in total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively. When adjusted for PM2.5, the effects of black carbon increased and remained statistically significant; in contrast, the associations of PM2.5 with daily mortality decreased and became statistically insignificant after adjustment for black carbon. To our knowledge, this is the first study in China, or even in Asian developing countries, to report the acute effect of black carbon and PM2.5 on daily mortality simultaneously. Our findings suggest that black carbon is a valuable additional air quality indicator to evaluate the health risks of ambient particles.},

	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) emission characteristics of a four-stroke diesel engine were investigated while operating on low-sulfur marine gas oil. PM size distributions appeared to be unimodal (accumulation mode) with fairly constant count median diameter (CMD) of 55–65 nm for all test modes at maximum engine speed. The slightly bigger CMD of around 76 nm for unimodal particle size distributions at 1080 rpm at medium- and high-load conditions was observed. The bimodal size distribution was registered only at very low load with nuclei CMD being below 15 nm, accumulation CMD of around 82 nm and percentage of nanoparticles of around 65\%. The study of primary dilution air temperature (PDT) effect revealed a significant reduction in total particle number for all operating conditions when PDT was increased from 30 °C to 400 °C. This also had an effect on particle CMD values and is believed to be due to evaporation of sulfuric acid with bound water and certain organic fractions that were formed during dilution process (at PDT = 30 °C). At very low load intermediate speed conditions, the heating of dilution air had a very little effect on the nucleation mode, which could suggest that it primarily consists of heavy hydrocarbons associated with lubrication oil.},

How this variability may alter the direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF), however, is largely unknown. To quantify changes in the time-averaged DARF, we perform an assessment of 29 days of high temporal resolution ground-based data collected during the Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP) on Cape Cod, which is downwind of metropolitan areas. We demonstrate that strong diurnal changes of aerosol loading (about 20\% on average) have a negligible impact on the 24-h average DARF when daily averaged optical properties are used to find this quantity. However, when there is a sparse temporal sampling of aerosol properties, which may preclude the calculation of daily averaged optical properties, large errors (up to 100\%) in the computed DARF may occur. We describe a simple way of reducing these errors, which suggests the minimal temporal sampling needed to accurately find the forcing.},

	abstract = {In this work, the source of ambient particulate matter (PM10) collected over a one-year period at an urban background site in Lens (France) was determined and investigated using a positive matrix factorization receptor model (US EPA PMF v3.0). In addition, a potential source contribution function (PSCF) was performed by means of the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (Hysplit) v4.9 model to assess prevailing geographical origins of the identified sources. A selective iteration process was followed for the qualification of the more robust and meaningful PMF solution. Components measured and used in the PMF included inorganic and organic species: soluble ionic species, trace elements, elemental carbon (EC), sugar alcohols, sugar anhydride, and organic carbon (OC). The mean PM10 concentration measured from March 2011 to March 2012 was about 21 μg m−3 with typically OM, nitrate and sulfate contributing to most of the mass and accounting respectively for 5.8, 4.5 and 2.3 μg m−3 on a yearly basis. Accordingly, PMF outputs showed that the main emission sources were (in decreasing order of contribution) secondary inorganic aerosols (28\% of the total PM10 mass), aged marine emissions (19\%), with probably predominant contribution of shipping activities, biomass burning (13\%), mineral dust (13\%), primary biogenic emissions (9\%), fresh sea salts (8\%), primary traffic emissions (6\%) and heavy oil combustion (4\%). Significant temporal variations were observed for most of the identified sources. In particular, biomass burning emissions were negligible in summer but responsible for about 25\% of total PM10 and 50\% of total OC in wintertime. Conversely, primary biogenic emissions were found to be negligible in winter but to represent about 20\% of total PM10 and 40\% of total OC in summer. The latter result calls for more investigations of primary biogenic aerosols using source apportionment studies, which quite usually disregard this type of source. This study further underlines the major influence of secondary processes during daily threshold exceedances. Finally, apparent discrepancies that could be generally observed between filter-based studies (such as the present one) and aerosol mass spectrometer-based PMF analyses (organic fractions) are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Changes in emissions and wind are often identified as the two dominant factors contributing to year-to-year variations in the concentration of primary pollutants. However, because changes in wind and emissions are intertwined, it has been difficult to quantitatively differentiate their effects on air quality directly from observed data. In particular, if the annual mean concentration of pollutants is higher than the previous year, it is difficult to identify whether the deterioration in air quality is caused by wind blowing from more polluted regions or an increase in contributing emissions. In this paper, based on wind and pollution roses, we propose a method to differentiate the effects of wind and non-wind (e.g., emissions) changes using direct observation. An index (L) is first defined to quantify the validity of the linear decomposition. The method is then validated by idealized experiments, numerical experiments and a two-year observation dataset from an actual emissions control program. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method by studying long-term PM10 variations in Hong Kong during 2000-2011. We find that for most of the period, the linear decomposition of the changes in annual PM10 is valid (up to 90\% confidence) and is dominated by the change in non-wind effects (e.g., emissions), whereas the average absolute effect from the wind variability is about 20\%. Sensitivity analyses also suggest that our method should work in any location as long as the observed wind and pollution data have sufficient duration and resolution to resolve the corresponding wind and pollution roses.},

	abstract = {Black carbon, brown carbon, and mineral dust are three of the most important light absorbing aerosols. Their optical properties differ greatly and are distinctive functions of the wavelength of light. Most optical instruments that quantify light absorption, however, are unable to distinguish one type of absorbing aerosol from another. It is thus instructive to separate total absorption from these different light absorbers to gain a better understanding of the optical characteristics of each aerosol type. During the EAST-AIRE (East Asian Study of Tropospheric Aerosols: an International Regional Experiment) campaign near Beijing, we measured light scattering using a nephelometer, and light absorption using an aethalometer and a particulate soot absorption photometer. We also measured the total mass concentrations of carbonaceous (elemental and organic carbon) and inorganic particulates, as well as aerosol number and mass distributions. We were able to identify periods during the campaign that were dominated by dust, biomass burning, fresh (industrial) chimney plumes, other coal burning pollution, and relatively clean (background) air for Northern China. Each of these air masses possessed distinct intensive optical properties, including the single scatter albedo and Ångstrom exponents. Based on the wavelength-dependence and particle size distribution, we apportioned total light absorption to black carbon, brown carbon, and dust; their mass absorption efficiencies at 550 nm were estimated to be 9.5, 0.5 (a lower limit value), and 0.03 m2/g, respectively. While agreeing with the common consensus that black carbon is the most important light absorber in the mid-visible, we demonstrated that brown carbon and dust could also cause significant absorption, especially at shorter wavelengths.},

	abstract = {The history of air masses is often investigated using backward trajectories to gain knowledge about processes along the air parcel path as well as possible source regions. Here, we describe a refined approach that incorporates airborne gas, aerosol, and environmental data into back trajectories and show how this technique allows for simultaneous evaluation of air mass history and back trajectory reliability without the need to calculate trajectory errors.
 We use the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and add a simple semi-automated computing routine to facilitate high-frequency coverage of back trajectories initiated along free tropospheric (FT) flight tracks and profiles every 10 s. We integrate our in situ physiochemical data by color-coding each of these trajectories with its corresponding in situ tracer values measured at the back trajectory start points along the flight path. The unique color for each trajectory aids assessment of trajectory reliability through the visual clustering of air mass pathways of similar coloration. Moreover, marked changes in trajectories associated with marked changes evident in measured physiochemical or thermodynamic properties of an air mass add credence to trajectories. This is particularly true when these air mass properties are linked to trajectory features characteristic of recognized sources or processes. This visual clustering of air mass pathways is of particular value for large-scale 3-D flight tracks common to aircraft experiments where air mass features of interest are often spatially distributed and temporally separated.
 The cluster-visualization tool used here reveals that most FT back trajectories with pollution signatures measured in the central equatorial Pacific reach back to sources on the South American continent over 10 000 km away and 12 days back in time, e.g., the Amazonian basin. We also demonstrate the distinctions in air mass properties between these and trajectories that penetrate deep convection in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone. Additionally, for the first time we show consistency of modeled precipitation along back trajectories with scavenging signatures in the aerosol measured for these trajectories.},

	abstract = {We analyzed 40-year datasets of daily average visibility (a proxy for surface aerosol concentration) and hourly precipitation at seven weather stations, including three stations located on the Taihang Mountains, during the summertime in northern China. There was no significant trend in summertime total precipitation at almost all stations. However, light rain decreased, whereas heavy rain increased as visibility decreased over the period studied. The decrease in light rain was seen in both orographic-forced shallow clouds and meso-scale stratiform clouds. The consistent trends in observed changes in visibility, precipitation, and orographic factor appear to be a testimony to the effects of aerosols. The potential impact of large-scale environmental factors, such as precipitable water, convective available potential energy, and vertical wind shear, on precipitation was investigated. No direct links were found. To validate our observational hypothesis about aerosol effects, Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations with spectral-bin microphysics at the cloud-resolving scale were conducted. Model results confirmed the role of aerosol indirect effects in reducing the light rain amount and frequency in the mountainous area for both orographic-forced shallow clouds and meso-scale stratiform clouds and in eliciting a different response in the neighboring plains. The opposite response of light rain to the increase in pollution when there is no terrain included in the model suggests that orography is likely a significant factor contributing to the opposite trends in light rain seen in mountainous and plain areas.},

	abstract = {Given two time series, can one tell, in a rigorous and quantitative way, the cause and effect between them? Based on a recently rigorized physical notion namely information flow, we arrive at a concise formula and give this challenging question, which is of wide concern in different disciplines, a positive answer. Here causality is measured by the time rate of change of information flowing from one series, say, X2, to another, X1. The measure is asymmetric between the two parties and, particularly, if the process underlying X1 does not depend on X2, then the resulting causality from X2 to X1 vanishes. The formula is tight in form, involving only the commonly used statistics, sample covariances. It has been validated with touchstone series purportedly generated with one-way causality. It has also been applied to the investigation of real world problems; an example presented here is the cause-effect relation between two climate modes, El Ni{\textbackslash}{\textasciitilde}no and Indian Ocean Dipole, which have been linked to the hazards in far flung regions of the globe, with important results that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain.},

	abstract = {During 4 years of research cruises over the central Pacific Ocean from 1993 through 1996, a region of extremely high concentration of black carbon aerosol ({\textgreater}150 ng C m−3) was routinely observed in the middle-latitude zone (27°–48°N) along the 175°E line of longitude (near the International Date Line). In the cruises along the latitude lines of 30°N and 35°N, a strong west-to-east gradient of black carbon was also observed. Backward trajectory analysis shows that the air parcels containing high concentration of black carbon had passed over the Asian continent during the previous 10 days. The concentration of black carbon was relatively well correlated with non-sea-salt (nss.) SO42− in the aerosols. This indicates that the high concentration of black carbon observed originated from the combustion of sulfur-containing materials, presumably coal, on the Asian continent. Mass size distributions of the black carbon exhibit a mode at 0.5–0.7 μm in aerodynamic diameter, which is unexpectedly large and coincides with the mode of SO42− aerosol. This suggests that black carbon and SO42− were internally mixed, and additional growth in particle size occurred through cloud processing. This study shows that anthropogenic aerosols are transported over greater distances than previously indicated by global dispersion models. The trajectory analysis indicates that this is due to the high-altitude transport of materials which reduces the possibility of encountering precipitating clouds; the aerosols are lofted over the continent initially, transported at relatively high altitudes over the ocean, and then brought to the surface in the central part of the North Pacific Ocean by mesoscale weather systems. The measured mixing ratio of black carbon/nss.SO42− and the state of the mixture (internal) suggest that the aerosols transported from Asia over the North Pacific Ocean have a low single-scattering albedo.},

Knowledge of the morphology and mixing of soot particles is fundamental to understand their potential health and climatic impacts. We investigate 5738 single particles collected at six different cloverleaf freeway on-ramps in Southern Michigan, using 2D images from scanning electron microscopy. Of those, 3364 particles are soot. We present an analysis of the morphological and mixing properties of those soot particles. The relative abundance of soot particles shows a positive association with traffic density (number of vehicles per minute). A classification of the mixing state of freshly emitted soot particles shows that most of them are bare (or thinly coated) (72\%) and some are partly coated (22\%). We find that the fractal dimension of soot particles (one of the most relevant morphological descriptors) varies from site to site, and increases with increasing vehicle specific power that represents the driving/engine load conditions, and with increasing percentage of vehicles older than 15 years. Our results suggest that driving conditions, and vehicle age and type have significant influence on the morphology of soot particles.},

	abstract = {Analyzing CO\$\_2\$ emission inventories of 256 cities from 33 countries we find power-law correlations between the emissions and city size, measured in population. The results suggest that in developing countries, large cities emit more CO\$\_2\$ per capita compared to small cities, i.e.{\textbackslash} they tend to exhibit super-linear correlations, where doubling the population of any city typically implies up to a \$115\${\textbackslash}\% increase of emissions. The results suggest the opposite for developed countries, i.e.{\textbackslash} linear or sub-linear correlations. This implies better efficiency of large cities, where doubling the population of any city typically implies only an \$80\${\textbackslash}\% increase of emissions. The transition occurs at approximately \$10,000\${\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\$ GDP(PPP)/cap. We derive how the total emissions of an entire country relate with the power-law correlations and find that in any case the size of the country is most important. The size of the most populated city dominates in the case of super-linear correlations. From the climate change mitigation point of view we conclude that urbanization is desirable in developed countries and should be accompanied by efficiency-increasing mechanisms in developing countries. More data acquisition is needed to support our empirical findings.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have associated ambient particulate chemical constituents with adverse cardiopulmonary health effects. However, specific pollution sources behind the cardiopulmonary health effects of ambient particles are uncertain. We examined the cardiopulmonary health effects of fine particles (PM2.5) from different pollution sources in Beijing, China, among a panel of 40 healthy university students. Study subjects were repeatedly examined for a series of cardiopulmonary health indicators during three 2-month-long study periods (suburban period, urban period 1, and urban period 2) in 2010?2011 before and after relocating from a suburban campus to an urban campus with changing air pollution levels and contents. Daily ambient PM2.5 mass samples were collected over the study and measured for 29 chemical constituents in the laboratory. Source appointment for ambient PM2.5 was performed using Positive Matrix Factorization, and mixed-effects models were used to estimate the cardiopulmonary effects associated with source-specific PM2.5 concentrations. Seven PM2.5 sources were identified as traffic emissions (12.0\%), coal combustion (22.0\%), secondary sulfate/nitrate (30.2\%), metallurgical emission (0.4\%), dust/soil (12.4\%), industry (6.9\%), and secondary organic aerosol (9.9\%). Ambient PM2.5 in the suburban campus had larger contributions from secondary sulfate/nitrate (41.8\% vs. 22.9\%?26.0\%) and metallurgical emission (0.7\% vs. 0.3\%) as compared to that in the urban campus), whereas PM2.5 in the urban campus had larger contributions from traffic emissions (13.0\%?16.3\% vs. 5.1\%), coal combustion (21.0\%?30.7\% vs. 10.7\%), and secondary organic aerosol (9.7\%?12.0\% vs. 8.7\%) as compared to that in the suburban campus. Potential key sources were identified for PM2.5 effects on inflammatory biomarkers (secondary sulfate/nitrate and dust/soil), blood pressure (coal combustion and metallurgical emission), and pulmonary function (dust/soil and industry). Analyses using another source appointment tool Unmix yielded a similar pattern of source contributions and associated health effects. In conclusion, ambient PM2.5 in Beijing suburban and urban areas has two distinct patterns of source contributions, and PM2.5 from different sources may play important roles on different aspects of PM2.5-related cardiopulmonary health effects.},

We assess the diurnal variation in ion concentration and mobility, variability with meteorological parameters and features within the ion mobility spectra. Ion concentration (typically in the range 100–1000 cm-3) was highest overnight and lowest in late morning and afternoon. Total conductivity also followed this trend suggesting small ions contribute more to conductivity than larger charged particles, although at the semi-rural site indoor activity produced charged aerosol intermittently, while infiltration of outdoor aerosol contributed at the urban site. Negative ion mobility (typically 1.6-1.9 cm2 V−1 s−1) was higher overnight than at other times, while positive ion mobility (typically 1.2-1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1) showed no diurnal variability. In general, temperature, pressure, wind speed and water vapour pressure were inversely related to both concentration and mobility, except outdoors when (negative) mobility increased with increasing temperature and pressure, while increased RH was associated with higher ion mobilities and concentrations. Analysis of high-resolution mobility spectra revealed several mobilities for each polarity at which peaks were identified across all sites, suggesting similarity in composition, but with varying importance at each site. Intermediate ions (mobilities 0.2-0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1) were observed at the outdoor site, but individual nucleation events which may be associated with them were not identifiable.},

	abstract = {A statistical algorithm was developed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations over Europe based on a weather-type representation of the meteorology. We used modeled PM2.5 concentrations as pseudo-observations, because of a lack of PM2.5 speciated measurements over Europe, and included four meteorological variables. This algorithm was evaluated on the learning period (2000-2008) to test its ability to reproduce the pseudo-observed data set and then applied for two climatological scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), one historical (1975-2004) and two future periods (2020-2049 and 2070-2099). In Italy, Poland, northern, eastern, and southeastern Europe, all future scenarios lead to decreases in PM2.5, whereas, in the Balkans, Benelux, the U.K., and northern France, they lead to increases in PM2.5. Considering each season separately shows stronger responses, which may vary for a given region and scenario. Decomposing the changes in PM2.5 concentrations as the sum of inter-type and intra-type changes, and a residual term shows that: (1) the residual term is negligible, (2) inter-type changes affect more the regions along the Atlantic Ocean, (3) in most other regions, inter-type and intra-type changes are often on the same order of magnitude. The relationship between the atmospheric circulation and weather-types evolves, and therefore modifies the mean of meteorological variables and PM2.5 concentrations. This algorithm offers a novel approach to investigate the effect of climate change on air quality, and can be applied to other pollutants, regions, and meteorological models. Furthermore, this approach can be applied using actual speciated PM2.5 observations, if a sufficiently dense monitoring network were available.},

	abstract = {Active-sampling approaches are commonly used for personal monitoring, but are limited by energy usage and data that may not represent an individual?s exposure or bioavailable concentrations. Current passive techniques often involve extensive preparation, or are developed for only a small number of targeted compounds. In this work, we present a novel application for measuring bioavailable exposure with silicone wristbands as personal passive samplers. Laboratory methodology affecting precleaning, infusion, and extraction were developed from commercially available silicone, and chromatographic background interference was reduced after solvent cleanup with good extraction efficiency ({\textgreater}96\%). After finalizing laboratory methods, 49 compounds were sequestered during an ambient deployment which encompassed a diverse set of compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), consumer products, personal care products, pesticides, phthalates, and other industrial compounds ranging in log Kow from ?0.07 (caffeine) to 9.49 (tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate). In two hot asphalt occupational settings, silicone personal samplers sequestered 25 PAHs during 8- and 40-h exposures, as well as 2 oxygenated-PAHs (benzofluorenone and fluorenone) suggesting temporal sensitivity over a single work day or week (p {\textless} 0.05, power =0.85). Additionally, the amount of PAH sequestered differed between worksites (p {\textless} 0.05, power = 0.99), suggesting spatial sensitivity using this novel application.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian source apportionment (SA) method is developed to provide source impact estimates and associated uncertainties. Bayesian-based ensemble averaging of multiple models provides new source profiles for use in a chemical mass balance (CMB) SA of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The approach estimates source impacts and their uncertainties by using a short-term application of four individual SA methods: three receptor-based models and one chemical transport model. The method is used to estimate two seasonal distributions of source profiles that are used in SA for a long-term PM2.5 data set. For each day in a long-term PM2.5 data set, 10 source profiles are sampled from these distributions and used in a CMB application, resulting in 10 SA results for each day. This formulation results in a distribution of daily source impacts rather than a single value. The average and standard deviation of the distribution are used as the final estimate of source impact and a measure of uncertainty, respectively. The Bayesian-based source impacts for biomass burning correlate better with observed levoglucosan (R2 = 0.66) and water-soluble potassium (R2 = 0.63) than source impacts estimated using more traditional methods and more closely agrees with observed total mass. The Bayesian approach also captures the expected seasonal variation of biomass burning and secondary impacts and results in fewer days with sources having zero impact. Sensitivity analysis found that using non-informative prior weighting performed better than using weighting based on method-derived uncertainties. This approach can be applied to long-term data sets from speciation network sites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). In addition to providing results that are more consistent with independent observations and known emission sources being present, the distributions of source impacts can be used in epidemiologic analyses to estimate uncertainties associated with the SA results.},

Moreover, the fan?s frequency was adjusted from 30 to 60 Hz to investigate the effect of wind velocity on PM removal efficiency. As a result, PM removal efficiency increased as the number of magnetic filters or fan frequency increased. We obtained maximum removal efficiency of PM10 (52\%), PM2.5 (46\%), and PM1 (38\%) at a 60 Hz fan frequency using double magnetic filters. We also found that the stability of the PM removal efficiency by the double filter (RSD, 3.2?5.8\%) was higher than that by a single filter (10.9?24.5\%) at all fan operating conditions.},

Here, we find that the observed all-sky solar brightening (4.06 ± 0.60 W m− 2 decade− 1) trend (1990–2005) over Europe from seven out of eight models (historical simulations in the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) scales well with the regional and global mean adjusted forcing by anthropogenic aerosols (idealised “present-day” - “pre-industrial” runs). The former is the observable from measurements, which then allows to infer a total aerosol adjusted forcing at about − 1.30 W m− 2 with standard deviation, ± 0.40 W m− 2. The reason is that models that simulate stronger forcing efficiencies and stronger radiative effects by aerosol-cloud interactions show both a stronger aerosol forcing and a stronger solar brightening.},

	abstract = {Air pollution emissions regulation can affect the location, size, and technology choice of potential biofuel production facilities. Difficulty in obtaining air pollutant emission permits and the cost of air pollution control devices have been cited by some fuel producers as barriers to development. This paper expands on the Geospatial Bioenergy Systems Model (GBSM) to evaluate the effect of air pollution control costs on the availability, cost, and distribution of U.S. biofuel production by subjecting potential facility locations within U.S. Clean Air Act nonattainment areas, which exceed thresholds for healthy air quality, to additional costs. This paper compares three scenarios: one with air quality costs included, one without air quality costs, and one in which conversion facilities were prohibited in Clean Air Act nonattainment areas. While air quality regulation may substantially affect local decisions regarding siting or technology choices, their effect on the system as a whole is small. Most biofuel facilities are expected to be sited near to feedstock supplies, which are seldom in nonattainment areas. The average cost per unit of produced energy is less than 1\% higher in the scenarios with air quality compliance costs than in scenarios without such costs. When facility construction is prohibited in nonattainment areas, the costs increase by slightly over 1\%, due to increases in the distance feedstock is transported to facilities in attainment areas.},

All test engines were equipped with a combination of a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and a partial diesel particulate filter (pDPF). At steady operating conditions, the formation of semivolatile nucleation particles directly depended on SO2 conversion in the catalyst. The nucleation particle emission was most significant after a rapid increase in engine load and exhaust gas temperature. Results indicate that the nucleation particle formation at transient driving conditions does not require compounds such as hydrocarbons or sulfated hydrocarbons, however, it cannot be explained only by the nucleation of sulfuric acid. A real-world exhaust study with a heavy duty diesel truck showed that the nucleation particle formation occurs even with ultralow sulfur diesel fuel, even at downhill driving conditions, and that nucleation particles can contribute 60\% of total particle number emissions. In general, due to sulfur storage and release within the exhaust aftertreatment systems and transients in driving, emissions of nucleation particles can even be the dominant part of modern diesel vehicle exhaust particulate number emissions.},

The vertical profile of BrC affects its radiative forcing, yet the distribution of BrC in the free troposphere is largely unknown. In this study, BrC absorption was directly measured in solvent extracts of particulate filters obtained from aircraft sampling over the continental USA. Excluding biomass burning plumes, BrC was observed throughout the tropospheric column ({\textless}13 km) and its prevalence increased relative to BC with increasing altitude, indicating contributions from secondary sources. Closure analysis showed good agreement between light absorption from BC plus BrC relative to measured total aerosol absorption. A radiative transfer model indicated that BrC absorption reduced top of atmosphere aerosol forcing by 20\% suggesting that it is an important component of direct aerosol radiative forcing.},

Two types of experiments are performed. In HO2-dominant experiments, organic peroxy radicals (RO2) primarily react with HO2. In mixed experiments, RO2 reacts through multiple pathways, including with NO, NO2, and HO2. The volatility and oxidation state of isoprene SOA are sensitive to and exhibit a nonlinear dependence on NOx levels. Depending on the NOx levels, the SOA formed in mixed experiments can be of similar or lower volatility compared to that formed in HO2-dominant experiments. The dependence of SOA yield, volatility, and oxidation state on the NOx level likely arises from gas-phase RO2 chemistry and succeeding particle-phase oligomerization reactions. The NOx level also plays a strong role in SOA aging. While the volatility of SOA in mixed experiments does not change substantially over time, SOA becomes less volatile and more oxidized as oxidation progresses in HO2-dominant experiments.},

Although setting the vehicle ventilation system to recirculation (RC) mode can reduce in-cabin UFPs by ?90\%, passenger-exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) can quickly accumulate inside the cabin. Using outdoor air (OA) mode instead can provide sufficient air exchange to prevent CO2 buildup, but in-cabin UFP concentrations would increase. To overcome this dilemma, we developed a simultaneous mitigation method for UFP and CO2 using high-efficiency cabin air (HECA) filtration in OA mode. Concentrations of UFP and other air pollutants were simultaneously monitored in and out of 12 different vehicles under 3 driving conditions: stationary, on local roadways, and on freeways. Under each experimental condition, data were collected with no filter, in-use original equipment manufacturer (OEM) filter, and two types of HECA filters. The HECA filters offered an average in-cabin UFP reduction of 93\%, much higher than the OEM filters (?50\% on average). Throughout the measurements, the in-cabin CO2 concentration remained in the range of 620?930 ppm, significantly lower than the typical level of 2500?4000 ppm observed in the RC mode.},

	abstract = {Although ground measurements have contributed to revealing the association between ambient air pollution and health effects in epidemiological studies, exposure measurement errors are likely to be caused because of the sparse spatial distribution of ground monitors. In this study, we estimate daily ground NO2 concentrations in the New England region, U.S., for the period 2005?2010 using satellite remote sensing data in combination with land use regression. To estimate ground-level NO2 concentrations, we constructed a mixed effects model by taking advantage of spatial and temporal variability in satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) tropospheric column NO2 densities. Using fine-scale land use parameters, we derived NO2 concentrations at point locations, which can be further used for subject-specific exposure estimates in epidemiological studies. A mixed effects model showed a reasonably high predictive power for daily NO2 concentrations (cross-validation R2 = 0.79). We observed that the model performed similarly in each season, year, and state. The spatial patterns of model estimates reflected emission source areas (such as high populated/traffic areas) in the study region and revealed the seasonal characteristics of NO2. This study suggests that a combination of satellite remote sensing and land use regression can be useful for both spatially and temporally resolved exposure assessments of NO2.},

The hybrid system's background error covariances (BECs) were a blend of those in 3DVAR and produced by the cycling EnSRF system, and the 3DVAR, EnSRF, and hybrid systems differed almost exclusively by their BECs. New analyses were produced every 6-hrs between 0000 UTC 1 June and 1800 UTC 14 July 2010 over a domain encompassing the contiguous United States (CONUS) and adjacent areas. Additionally, a control experiment that only assimilated meteorological observations was performed. Each 1800 UTC analysis initialized a 48-hr Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model forecast. These forecasts were evaluated with a focus on air quality prediction. The ensemble aerosol spread was generally insufficient, particularly over the western CONUS. However, despite the sub-optimal ensemble spread, the hybrid system performed quite well and usually produced the best aerosol forecasts. Additionally, both the 3DVAR- and EnSRF- initialized forecasts typically outperformed the control. These results are encouraging and suggest the resiliency of the hybrid method. Improved aerosol ensembles should translate into even better future hybrid forecasts.},

High time-resolution (30 min) PM2.5 sampling was conducted for a month during the summer of 2006 in Steubenville, OH, an EPA designated nonattainment area for the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). When the data were evaluated, the species clusters from ReSCUE matched extremely well with the source types identified by EPA Unmix demonstrating that ReSCUE is a valuable tool in identifying source types. Results from EPA Unmix show that contributions to PM2.5 are mostly from iron/steel manufacturing (36\% ± 9\%), crustal matter (33\% ± 11\%), and coal combustion (11\% ± 19\%). More importantly, ReSCUE was useful in (i) providing objective data driven guidance for the number of source factors and key fitting species for EPA Unmix, and (ii) detecting tenuous associations between some species and source types in the results derived by EPA Unmix.},

Among the various hazards of PM pollutants, microorganisms in PM2.5 and PM10 are thought to be responsible for various allergies and for the spread of respiratory diseases. While the physical and chemical properties of PM pollutants have been extensively studied, much less is known about the inhalable microorganisms. Most existing data on airborne microbial communities using 16S or 18S rRNA gene sequencing to categorize bacteria or fungi into the family or genus levels do not provide information on their allergenic and pathogenic potentials. Here we employed metagenomic methods to analyze the microbial composition of Beijing?s PM pollutants during a severe January smog event. We show that with sufficient sequencing depth, airborne microbes including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and dsDNA viruses can be identified at the species level. Our results suggested that the majority of the inhalable microorganisms were soil-associated and nonpathogenic to human. Nevertheless, the sequences of several respiratory microbial allergens and pathogens were identified and their relative abundance appeared to have increased with increased concentrations of PM pollution. Our findings may serve as an important reference for environmental scientists, health workers, and city planners.},

These regulations have accelerated fleet turnover to cleaner and newer trucks. In this study, a mobile platform was used to measure nitrogen oxides (NOX), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particles (UFPs) on diesel-dominated southern California freeways. Fleet-averaged fuel-based emission factors were calculated for diesel trucks and the results showed NOX and BC emissions were reduced by 40\% or more between 2009 and 2011, but there were no statistically significant reductions for UFP. Technologies associated with these new trucks, mainly diesel particulate filters, have changed the physical characteristics of diesel particulate, shifting the size distribution of such particles to smaller modes (10?20 nm). In addition, integration of 2007 MY trucks into the fleet was also observed in on-road ratios of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and NOX. NO2/NOX ratios steadily increased from 0.23 ± 0.06 in 2009 to 0.30 ± 0.03 in 2010 but plateaued and declined in 2011.},

TRMM data used are from the lightning imaging sensor (LIS) and the precipitation radar (PR). Surface data are human-observed thunderstorm occurrence and visibility for the period of 1990-2012 at 70 plain stations and 4 mountain stations. Thunderstorm and lightning activity, as well as PR echo-top heights, have all increased significantly over the region during the period under study, while regional mean visibility has decreased greatly at the plain stations. The daily rainfall amount during thunderstorm days has increased significantly, but rainfall without thunderstorms has no trend during this period. In comparison, the four mountain weather stations at elevations greater than 1100 m showed little trend in the number of thunderstorm days during the period of 1990-2012. The ratio of the number of thunderstorm days between plain and mountain stations has increased significantly. The distinct trends seen between plain and mountain stations may originate from large differences in aerosol concentration between the plain and mountain regions. The accumulation of pollution aerosols in the plain region likely invigorates thunderstorms, whereas a lesser, or no, impact on intense convection is found over high-altitude regions.},

This study investigated residential ESP filters to reduce ultrafine particles between 4 to 15 nm and quantified the resulting ozone generation. In-duct ESPs were operated in the central air handling unit of a test house. Results for the two tested ESP brands indicate that removal efficiency of 8 to 14 nm particles was near zero and always less than 10\% (±15\%), possibly due to particle generation or low charging efficiency. Adding a media filter downstream of the ESP increased the decay rate for particles in the same size range. Continuous operation of one brand of ESP raised indoor ozone concentrations to 77 ppbv and 20 ppbv for a second brand. Using commercial filters containing activated carbon downstream of the installed ESP reduced the indoor steady-state ozone concentrations between 6\% and 39\%.},

	abstract = {A mobile platform for flux measurements of VOCs (alkanes and alkenes), SO2 and NO2 emissions using the Solar Occultation Flux method and Mobile DOAS was used in four different studies to measure industrial emissions. The studies were carried out in several large conglomerates of oil refineries and petrochemical industries in Southeast and East Texas in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2012. The measured alkane emissions from the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) have been fairly stable between 2006 and 2011, averaging about 11500 kg/h, while the alkene emissions have shown greater variations. The ethene and propene emissions measured from the HSC were 1511 kg/h and 878 kg/h respectively in 2006, while dropping to roughly 600 kg/h for both species in 2009 and 2011. The results were compared to annual inventory emissions, showing that measured VOC emissions were typically 5-15 times higher, while for SO2 and NO2 the ratio was typically 0.5-2. AP-42 emission factors were used to estimate meteorological effects on alkane emissions from tanks, showing that these emissions may have been up to 35-45 \% higher during the studies than the annual average. A more focused study of alkene emissions from a petrochemical complex in Longview in 2012 identified two upset episodes and the elevation of the total emissions during the measurement period due to the upsets was estimated to approximately 20 \%. Both meteorological and upset effects were small compared to the factor of 5-15, suggesting that VOC emissions are systematically and substantially underestimated in current emission inventories.},

	abstract = {We present an examination of the potential emissions and air quality benefits of shifting freight from truck to rail in the upper Midwestern United States. Using a novel, freight-specific emissions inventory (the Wisconsin Inventory of Freight Emissions, WIFE) and a three-dimensional Eulerian photochemical transport model (the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model, CMAQ), we quantify how specific freight mode choices impact ambient air pollution concentrations. Using WIFE, we developed two modal shift scenarios: one focusing on intraregional freight movements within the Midwest and a second on through-freight movements through the region. Freight truck and rail emissions inventories for each scenario were gridded to a 12 km ? 12 km horizontal resolution as input to CMAQ, along with emissions from all other major sectors, and three-dimensional time-varying meteorology from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The through-freight scenario reduced monthly mean (January and July) localized concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by 28\% (?2.33 ppbV) in highway grid cells, and reduced elemental carbon (EC) by 16\% (?0.05 ?g/m3) in highway grid cells. There were corresponding localized increases in railway grid cells of 25\% (+0.83 ppbV) for NO2, and 22\% (+0.05 ?g/m3) for EC. The through-freight scenario reduced CO2 emissions 31\% compared to baseline trucking. The through-freight scenario yields a July mean change in ground-level ambient PM2.5 and O3 over the central and eastern part of the domain (up to ?3\%).},

Results show that ω varies strongly with fire-integrated modified combustion efficiency (MCEFI)—higher MCEFI results in lower ω values and greater spectral dependence of ω. A parameterization of ω as a function of MCEFI for fresh BB aerosols is derived from the laboratory data and is evaluated by field observations from two wildfires. The parameterization suggests that MCEFI explains 60\% of the variability in ω, while the 40\% unexplained variability could be accounted for by other parameters such as fuel type. Our parameterization provides a promising framework that requires further validation and is amenable for refinements to predict ω with greater confidence, which is critical for estimating the radiative forcing of BB aerosols.},

The relation between sulfate and nitrate in PM10 and PM2.5 was examined based on these measurements. Results showed that the mass fraction of sulfate was strongly negatively correlated with that of nitrate in atmospheric particles on most of the sampling days, especially when sulfate and nitrate made up the vast majority of the total soluble anions and cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) made a small contribution to the total water soluble ions, revealing that the formation mechanisms of sulfate and nitrate in the atmosphere are highly correlated, and there exists a significant negative correlation trend between sulfate and nitrate mass fractions in the atmospheric particles. We found that the mass fractions of sulfate and nitrate varied with local meteorological conditions, and the latter presented opposite influences on the former. Further analysis indicated that the mass fractions of sulfate and nitrate in atmospheric particles were also modulated by the neutralizing level of atmospheric aerosols, and the negative correlation could be found in acidic atmospheric particles. Strong negative correlation was usually observed on clear days, hazy days, foggy days and respirable particulate air pollution days, whereas poor negative correlation was often observed during cloud, rain, snow, dust storm and suspended dust events. The results can help to better understand the formation mechanisms of atmospheric sulfate and nitrate during air pollution episodes, and to better explain field results of atmospheric chemistry concerning sulfate and nitrate.},

Using IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite measurements, high concentrations of key trace gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH3) along with ammonium sulfate aerosol ((NH4)2SO4) are found. We show that IASI is able to detect boundary layer pollution in case of large negative thermal contrast combined with high levels of pollution. Our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic key pollutants, such as CO and SO2, can be monitored by IASI in the North China Plain during wintertime in support of air quality evaluation and management.},

	abstract = {There has been considerable scientific interest in personal exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP). In this study, the inhaled particle surface area doses and dose relative intensities in the tracheobronchial and alveolar regions of lungs were calculated using measured 24-h UFP time series of school children personal exposures. Bayesian hierarchical modeling was used to determine mean doses and dose intensities for the various microenvironments. Analysis of measured personal exposures for 137 participating children from 25 schools in the Brisbane Metropolitan Area showed similar trends for all participating children. Bayesian regression modeling was performed to calculate the daily proportion of children?s total doses in different microenvironments. The proportion of total daily alveolar doses for home, school, commuting, and other were 55.3\%, 35.3\%, 4.5\%, and 5.0\%, respectively, with the home microenvironment contributing a majority of children?s total daily dose.

	abstract = {Dhaka had recently experienced rapid conversion of its motor vehicle fleet to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). This paper quantifies ex-post the air quality and climate benefits of the CNG conversion policy, including monetary valuations, through an impact pathway approach. Around 2045 (1665) avoided premature deaths in greater Dhaka (City Corporation) can be attributed to air quality improvements from the CNG conversion policy in 2010, resulting in a saving of around USD 400 million. Majority of these health benefits resulted from the conversion of high-emitting diesel vehicles. CNG conversion was clearly detrimental from climate change perspective using the changes in CO2 and CH4 only (CH4 emissions increased); however, after considering other global pollutants (especially black carbon), the climate impact was ambiguous. Uncertainty assessment using input distributions and Monte Carlo simulation along with a sensitivity analysis show that large uncertainties remain for climate impacts. For our most likely estimate, there were some climate costs, valued at USD 17.7 million, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the air quality benefits. This indicates that such policies can and should be undertaken on the grounds of improving local air pollution alone and that precautions should be taken to reduce the potentially unintended increases in GHG emissions or other unintended effects.},

	abstract = {Black carbon (BC) and other light absorbing particles deposited on snow and ice are known to perturb the surface radiative balance. There are few published observations of the concentration of these particles in the snow in Scandinavia and the European Arctic. We measured BC concentrations in snow samples collected in this region from 2007 to 2009, and we present the results here. The dataset includes 484 surface samples and 24 column samples (covering the accumulation season) from snow on land, glaciers, and sea ice. Concentrations up to 88 ng of carbon per g of snow (ng/g) were found in Scandinavia, while lower values were observed at higher latitudes: 11-14 ng/g in Svalbard, 7-42 ng/g in the Fram Strait, and 9 ng/g in Barrow. Values compare well with other observations, but are generally found to be a factor of 2-3 higher than modeled BC concentrations in snow in the chemical transport model Oslo CTM2. This model underestimation comes in spite of potentially significant undercatch in the observations. The spring melt period enhanced BC levels in surface snow at the four sites where the BC concentrations were monitored from March to May in 2008 and 2009. A dataset of replicate samples is used to establish a concentration-dependent estimate of the meter-scale variability of BC concentration in snow, found to be around ±30\% of the average concentration.},

However, these properties are modified shortly after emission by condensation of semi-volatile substances and coagulation withother particles. It is, therefore, unclear to what extent particle characteristics at emission affect CCN activity after aging by condensation and coagulation. We present a process-level analysis of particles emitted from a particular source, diesel engines, in which we isolate the separate effects of condensation and coagulation on the CCN activation of primary aerosol. We simulated aerosol dynamics in a polluted area with the Particle Monte Carlo (PartMC) model coupled to the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) and evaluated three factors influencing particle CCN activity shortly after emission: 1) particle characteristics at the time of emission, 2) aging conditions near the emission source, and 3) the water vapor supersaturation at which CCN activity is evaluated. CCN concentrations were sensitive to particle properties at emission only under specific environmental conditions. Diesel emissions did not strongly influence local CCN concentrations at low cloud supersaturation thresholds (s {\textless} 0.2\%), regardless of particle characteristics at emission or aging conditions. At higher supersaturation thresholds (s {\textless} 0.2\%) and under conditions of rapid secondary aerosol formation, changes in CCN concentrations showed a greater sensitivity to particles’ emission size than composition.},

In addition, a light-duty gasoline LEV vehicle and ultralow emission vehicle (ULEV), and a light-duty diesel passenger vehicle and gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicle were tested on a constant velocity driving cycle. A variety of instruments with response times ≥0.1 Hz were used to characterize how the emissions of the major particulate matter components varied for the LEVs during a typical driving cycle. This study focuses primarily on emissions of black carbon (BC). These measurements allowed for the determination of BC emission factors throughout the driving cycle, providing insights into the temporal variability of BC emission factors during different phases of a typical driving cycle.},

Here, we associate rainfall characteristics obtained by an S-Band radar in the Amazon with in situ measurements of biomass burning aerosols for the entire year of 2009. The most important results were obtained during the dry semester (July–December). The results indicate that the aerosol influence on precipitating systems is modulated by the atmospheric instability degree.  For stable atmospheres, the higher the aerosol concentration, the lower the precipitation over the region. On the other hand, for unstable cases, higher concentrations of particulate material are associated with more precipitation, elevated presence of ice and larger rain cells, which suggests an association with long lived systems. The results presented were statistically significant. However, due to the limitation imposed by the dataset used, some important features such as wet scavenging and droplet size distribution need further clarification. Regional climate model simulations in addition with new field campaigns could aggregate information to the aerosol/precipitation relationship.},

	abstract = {Ozone and PM2.5 concentrations over the city of Paris are modeled with the CHIMERE air-quality model at 4 km × 4 km horizontal resolution for two future emission scenarios. A high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) emission projection until 2020 for the greater Paris region is developed by local experts (AIRPARIF) and is further extended to year 2050 based on regional-scale emission projections developed by the Global Energy Assessment. Model evaluation is performed based on a 10-year control simulation. Ozone is in very good agreement with measurements while  PM2.5 is underestimated by 20\% over the urban area mainly due to a large wet bias in wintertime precipitation. A significant increase of maximum ozone relative to present-day levels over Paris is modeled under the "business-as-usual" scenario (+7 ppb) while a more optimistic "mitigation" scenario leads to a moderate ozone decrease (−3.5 ppb) in year 2050. These results are substantially different to previous regional-scale projections where 2050 ozone is found to decrease under both future scenarios. A sensitivity analysis showed that this difference is due to the fact that ozone formation over Paris at the current urban-scale study is driven by volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited chemistry, whereas at the regional-scale ozone formation occurs under NOx-sensitive conditions. This explains why the sharp NOx reductions implemented in the future scenarios have a different effect on ozone projections at different scales. In rural areas, projections at both scales yield similar results showing that the longer timescale processes of emission transport and ozone formation are less sensitive to model resolution. PM2.5 concentrations decrease by 78\% and 89\% under business-as-usual and mitigation scenarios, respectively, compared to the present-day period. The reduction is much more prominent over the urban part of the domain due to the effective reductions of road transport and residential emissions resulting in the smoothing of the large urban increment modeled in the control simulation.},

To characterize HAP exposure related to solid fuel use and ventilation patterns, an exposure assessment study of 163 nonsmoking female heads of households enrolled from 30 villages was conducted in Xuanwei and Fuyuan, two neighboring rural counties with high incidence of lung cancer due to the burning of smoky coal (a bituminous coal, which in health evaluations is usually compared to smokeless coal?an anthracite coal available in some parts of the area). Personal and indoor 24-h PM2.5 samples were collected over two consecutive days in each household, with approximately one-third of measurements retaken in a second season. The overall geometric means (GM) of personal PM2.5 concentrations in Xuanwei and Fuyuan were 166 [Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD):2.0] and 146 (GSD:1.9) ?g/m3, respectively, which were similar to the indoor PM2.5 air concentrations [GM(GSD):162 (2.1) and 136 (2.0) ?g/m3, respectively]. Personal PM2.5 was moderately highly correlated with indoor PM2.5 (Spearman r = 0.70, p {\textless} 0.0001). Burning wood or plant materials (tobacco stems, corncobs etc.) resulted in the highest personal PM2.5 concentrations (GM:289 and 225 ?g/m3, respectively), followed by smoky coal, and smokeless coal (GM:148 and 115 ?g/m3, respectively). PM2.5 levels of vented stoves were 34?80\% lower than unvented stoves and firepits across fuel types. Mixed effect models indicated that fuel type, ventilation, number of windows, season, and burning time per stove were the main factors related to personal PM2.5 exposure. Lower PM2.5 among vented stoves compared with unvented stoves and firepits is of interest as it parallels the observation of reduced risks of malignant and nonmalignant lung diseases in the region.},

	abstract = {In the winter of 2011, a field campaign was undertaken in the small township of Nelson, New Zealand to measure the vertical and horizontal distribution of concentrations of airborne particulate matter. The aim of this campaign was to improve our understanding of the causal factors which result in periods of very high concentrations of particulate pollution in small townships during winter where emissions are dominated by the combustion of wood for domestic heating. The results showed that mean hourly surface concentrations of particulates throughout the airshed were characterized by a distinctive diurnal cycle, with two peaks in concentration (one in the late evening and then, unusually, a second mid-morning). Although the timing and magnitude of hourly peak concentrations was variable throughout the valley, there was no evidence to suggest that regional or topographic flows played a significant role in the build-up of pollutants at any given location.

Analysis of vertical profiles of black carbon showed that high concentrations of particulates were confined to the lowest 50 m of the boundary layer. Concentrations decreased with increasing height within this polluted surface layer. The atmosphere was very stable during the evening period. After midnight, a period of increased mixing was consistently identified throughout the lowest 100 m of the boundary layer and associated with the sudden cleansing of the surface and lower layers of the boundary layer. Throughout the observational period there was no evidence for the storage of pollutants aloft. Thus the vertical mixing of pollutants to the surface could not account for increased pollutant concentrations during the morning period. However, at this time the boundary layer remained stable and concentrations of black carbon were mixed through a very shallow layer. This suggests that despite lower domestic heating emissions in the morning, the reduced mixing volume is a likely cause of the observed marked peak in morning surface concentrations.},

	abstract = {Particles containing black carbon (BC), a strong absorbing substance, exert a rather uncertain direct and indirect radiative forcing in the atmosphere. To investigate the mass concentration and absorption properties of BC particles over Central Europe, the model WRF-Chem was used at a resolution of 12 km in conjunction with a high resolution BC emission inventory (EUCAARI 42-Pan-European Carbonaceous Aerosol Inventory;  1/8° × 1/16°). The model simulation was evaluated using measurements of equivalent soot carbon, absorption coefficients and particle number concentrations at 7 sites within the German Ultrafine Aerosol Network, PM10 mass concentrations from the dense measurement network of the German Federal Environmental Agency at 392 monitoring stations, and aerosol optical depth from MODIS and AERONET. A distinct time period (25 March to 10 April 2009) was chosen, during which the clean marine air mass prevailed in the first week and afterwards the polluted continental air mass mainly from south-east dominated with elevated daily average BC concentration up to 4 μg m−3. The simulated PM10 mass concentration, aerosol number concentration and optical depth were in a good agreement with the observations, while the modelled BC mass concentrations were found to be a factor of 2 lower than the observations. Together with backtrajectories, detailed model bias analyses suggested that the current BC emission in countries to the east and south of Germany might be underestimated by a factor of 5, at least for the simulation period. Running the model with upscaled BC emissions in these regions led to a smaller model bias and a better correlation between model and measurement. On the contrary, the particle absorption coefficient was positively biased by about 20\% even when the BC mass concentration was underestimated by around 50\%. This indicates that the internal mixture treatment of BC in the WRF-Chem optical calculation is unrealistic in our case, which over amplifies the light absorption by BC containing particles. By adjusting the modeled mass absorption cross-section towards the measured values, the simulation of particle light absorption of BC was improved as well. Finally, the positive direct radiative forcing of BC particles at top of the atmosphere was estimated to be in the range of 0 to +4 W m−2 over Germany for the model run with improved BC mass concentration and adjusted BC light absorption cross-section. This treatment lowered the positive forcing of BC by up to 70\%, compared with the internal mixing treatment of BC in the model simulation.},

	abstract = {Despite increasing emission controls, particulate matter (PM) has remained a critical issue for European air quality in recent years. The various sources of PM, both from primary particulate emissions as well as secondary formation from precursor gases, make this a complex problem to tackle. In order to allow for credible predictions of future concentrations under policy assumptions, a modelling approach is needed that considers all chemical processes and spatial dimensions involved, from long-range transport of pollution to local emissions in street canyons. Here we describe a modelling scheme which has been implemented in the GAINS integrated assessment model to assess compliance with PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter {\textless} 10 μm) limit values at individual air quality monitoring stations reporting to the AirBase database. The modelling approach relies on a combination of bottom up modelling of emissions, simplified atmospheric chemistry and dispersion calculations, and a traffic increment calculation wherever applicable. At each monitoring station fulfilling a few data coverage criteria, measured concentrations in the base year 2009 are explained to the extent possible and then modelled for the past and future. More than 1850 monitoring stations are covered, including more than 300 traffic stations and 80\% of the stations which exceeded the EU air quality limit values in 2009. As a validation, we compare modelled trends in the period 2000–2008 to observations, which are well reproduced. The modelling scheme is applied here to quantify explicitly source contributions to ambient concentrations at several critical monitoring stations, displaying the differences in spatial origin and chemical composition of urban roadside PM10 across Europe. Furthermore, we analyse the predicted evolution of PM10 concentrations in the European Union until 2030 under different policy scenarios. Significant improvements in ambient PM10 concentrations are expected assuming successful implementation of already agreed legislation; however, these will not be large enough to ensure attainment of PM10 limit values in hot spot locations such as Southern Poland and major European cities. Remaining issues are largely eliminated in a scenario applying the best available emission control technologies to the maximal technically feasible extent.},

Each year in Saudi Arabia this situation is intensified during Hajj, the Holy Pilgrimage of Islam that draws millions of pilgrims to Mecca. An initial study of air quality in Mecca and surrounding holy sites during the 2012 Hajj (October 24?27) revealed strongly elevated levels of the combustion tracer carbon monoxide (CO, up to 57 ppmv) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) along the pilgrimage route?especially in the tunnels of Mecca?that are a concern for human health. The most abundant VOC was the gasoline evaporation tracer i-pentane, which exceeded 1200 ppbv in the tunnels. Even though VOC concentrations were generally lower during a follow-up non-Hajj sampling period (April 2013), many were still comparable to other large cities suffering from poor air quality. Major VOC sources during the 2012 Hajj study included vehicular exhaust, gasoline evaporation, liquefied petroleum gas, and air conditioners. Of the measured compounds, reactive alkenes and CO showed the strongest potential to form ground-level ozone. Because the number of pilgrims is expected to increase in the future, we present emission reduction strategies to target both combustive and evaporative fossil fuel sources.},

	abstract = {We systematically evaluate the black carbon (BC) simulations for 2006 over the Tibetan Plateau by a global 3-D chemical transport model (CTM) (GEOS-Chem) driven by GEOS-5 assimilated meteorological fields, using in situ measurements of BC in surface air, BC in snow, and BC absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD). Using improved anthropogenic BC emission inventories for Asia that account for rapid technology renewal and energy consumption growth (Zhang et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011) and improved global biomass burning emission inventories that account for small fires (van der Werf et al., 2010; Randerson et al., 2012), we find that model results of both BC in surface air and in snow are statistically in good agreement with observations (biases {\textless} 15\%) away from urban centers. Model results capture the seasonal variations of the surface BC concentrations at rural sites in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but the observed elevated values in winter are absent. Modeled surface-BC concentrations are within a factor of 2 of the observations at remote sites. Part of the discrepancy is explained by the deficiencies of the meteorological fields over the complex Tibetan terrain. We find that BC concentrations in snow computed from modeled BC deposition and GEOS-5 precipitation are spatiotemporally consistent with observations (r = 0.85). The computed BC concentrations in snow are a factor of 2–4 higher than the observations at several Himalayan sites because of excessive BC deposition. The BC concentrations in snow are biased low by a factor of 2 in the central plateau, which we attribute to the absence of snow aging in the CTM and strong local emissions unaccounted for in the emission inventories. Modeled BC AAOD is more than a factor of 2 lower than observations at most sites, particularly to the northwest of the plateau and along the southern slopes of the Himalayas in winter and spring, which is attributable in large part to underestimated emissions and the assumption of external mixing of BC aerosols in the model. We find that assuming a 50\% increase of BC absorption associated with internal mixing reduces the bias in modeled BC AAOD by 57\% in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the northeastern plateau and to the northeast of the plateau, and by 16\% along the southern slopes of the Himalayas and to the northwest of the plateau. Both surface BC concentration and AAOD are strongly sensitive to anthropogenic emissions (from China and India), while BC concentration in snow is especially responsive to the treatment of BC aerosol aging. We find that a finer model resolution (0.5° × 0.667° nested over Asia) reduces the bias in modeled surface-BC concentration from 15 to 2\%. The large range and non-homogeneity of discrepancies between model results and observations of BC across the Tibetan Plateau undoubtedly undermine current assessments of the climatic and hydrological impact of BC in the region and thus warrant imperative needs for more extensive measurements of BC, including its concentration in surface air and snow, AAOD, vertical profile and deposition.},

	abstract = {Emissions of air pollutants in East Asia play an important role in the regional and global atmospheric environment. In this study we evaluated the recent emission trends of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) in East Asia, and projected their future emissions up until 2030 with six emission scenarios. The results will provide future emission projections for the modeling community of the model inter-comparison program for Asia (MICS-Asia). During 2005–2010, the emissions of SO2 and PM2.5 in East Asia decreased by 15 and 12\%, respectively, mainly attributable to the large-scale deployment of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) at China's power plants, and the promotion of highly efficient PM removal technologies in China's power plants and cement industry. During this period, the emissions of NOx and NMVOC increased by 25 and 15\%, driven by rapid increase in the emissions from China due to inadequate control strategies. In contrast, the NOx and NMVOC emissions in East Asia except China decreased by 13–17\%, mainly due to the implementation of stringent vehicle emission standards in Japan and South Korea. Under current regulations and current levels of implementation, NOx, SO2, and NMVOC emissions in East Asia are projected to increase by about one-quarter over 2010 levels by 2030, while PM2.5 emissions are expected to decrease by 7\%. Assuming enforcement of new energy-saving policies, emissions of NOx, SO2, PM2.5 and NMVOC in East Asia are expected to decrease by 28, 36, 28, and 15\%, respectively, compared with the baseline case. The implementation of "progressive" end-of-pipe control measures would lead to another one-third reduction of the baseline emissions of NOx, and about one-quarter reduction of SO2, PM2.5, and NMVOC. Assuming the full application of technically feasible energy-saving policies and end-of-pipe control technologies, the emissions of NOx, SO2, and PM2.5 in East Asia would account for only about one-quarter, and NMVOC for one-third, of the levels of the baseline projection. Compared with previous projections, this study projects larger reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions by considering aggressive governmental plans and standards scheduled to be implemented in the next decade, and quantifies the significant effects of detailed progressive control measures on NMVOC emissions up until 2030.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from maritime shipping produce ozone (O3) and hydroxyl radicals (OH), which in turn destroy methane (CH4). The balance between this warming (due to O3) and cooling (due to CH4) determines the net effect of ship NOx on climate. Previous estimates of the chemical impact and radiative forcing (RF) of ship NOx have generally assumed that plumes of ship exhaust are instantly diluted into model grid cells spanning hundreds of kilometers, even though this is known to produce biased results. Here we improve the parametric representation of exhaust-gas chemistry developed in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) to provide the first estimate of RF from shipping that accounts for sub-grid-scale ship plume chemistry. The CTM now calculates O3 production and CH4 loss both within and outside the exhaust plumes and also accounts for the effect of wind speed. With the improved modeling of plumes, ship NOx perturbations are smaller than suggested by the ensemble of past global modeling studies, but if we assume instant dilution of ship NOx on the grid scale, the CTM reproduces previous model results. Our best estimates of the RF components from increasing ship NOx emissions by 1 Tg(N) yr−1 are smaller than that given in the past literature: + 3.4 ± 0.85 mW m−2 (1σ confidence interval) from the short-lived ozone increase, −5.7 ± 1.3 mW m−2 from the CH4 decrease, and −1.7 ± 0.7 mW m−2 from the long-lived O3 decrease that accompanies the CH4 change. The resulting net RF is −4.0 ± 2.0 mW m−2 for emissions of 1 Tg(N) yr−1. Due to non-linearity in O3 production as a function of background NOx, RF from large changes in ship NOx emissions, such as the increase since preindustrial times, is about 20\% larger than this RF value for small marginal emission changes. Using sensitivity tests in one CTM, we quantify sources of uncertainty in the RF components and causes of the ±30\% spread in past model results; the main source of uncertainty is the composition of the background atmosphere in the CTM, which is driven by model formulation (±10 to 20\%) and the plausible range of anthropogenic emissions (±10\%).},

	abstract = {This paper examines the effects on climate and air pollution of open biomass burning (BB) when heat and moisture fluxes, gases and aerosols (including black and brown carbon, tar balls, and reflective particles), cloud absorption effects (CAEs) I and II, and aerosol semi-direct and indirect effects on clouds are treated. It also examines the climate impacts of most anthropogenic heat and moisture fluxes (AHFs and AMFs). Transient 20-year simulations indicate BB may cause a net global warming of {\textasciitilde}0.4 K because CAE I ({\textasciitilde}32\% of BB warming), CAE II, semi-direct effects, AHFs ({\textasciitilde}7\%), AMFs, and aerosol absorption outweigh direct aerosol cooling and indirect effects, contrary to previous BB studies that did not treat CAEs, AHFs, AMFs, or brown carbon. Some BB warming can be understood in terms of the anti-correlation between instantaneous direct radiative forcing (DRF) changes and surface temperature changes in clouds containing absorbing aerosols. BB may cause {\textasciitilde}250,000 (73,000-435,000) premature mortalities/yr, with {\textgreater}90\% from particles. AHFs from all sources and AMFs + AHFs from power plants and electricity use each accounted for statistically significant +0.03 K global warming. Solar plus thermal-IR DRFs were +0.033 (+0.027) W/m2 for all AHFs globally without (with) evaporating cooling water, +0.009 W/m2 for AMFs globally, +0.52 W/m2 (94.3\% solar) for all-source BC outside of clouds plus interstitially between cloud drops at the cloud relative humidity, and +0.06 W/m2 (99.7\% solar) for BC inclusions in cloud hydrometeor particles. Modeled post-1850 biomass, biofuel, and fossil-fuel burning, AHFs, AMFs, and urban surfaces accounted for most observed global warming.},

In two successive years, we conducted environmental sampling, home inspections, and health questionnaires with families in green and conventional (control) apartments in two public housing developments. A subset of participants was followed as they moved from conventional to green or conventional to conventional housing. We measured particulate matter less than 2.5 ?m aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nicotine, carbon dioxide (CO2), and air exchange rate (AER) over a seven-day sampling period coincident with survey administration. In multivariate models, we observed 57\%, 65\%, and 93\% lower concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, and nicotine (respectively) in green vs control homes (p = 0.032, p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively), as well as fewer reports of mold, pests, inadequate ventilation, and stuffiness. Differences in formaldehyde and CO2 were not statistically significant. AER was marginally lower in green buildings (p = 0.109). Participants in green homes experienced 47\% fewer sick building syndrome symptoms (p {\textless} 0.010). We observed significant decreases in multiple indoor exposures and improved health outcomes among participants who moved into green housing, suggesting multilevel housing interventions have the potential to improve long-term resident health.},

	abstract = {Health effects attributed to outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) rank it among the risk factors with the highest health burdens in the world, annually accounting for over 3.2 million premature deaths and over 76 million lost disability-adjusted life years. Existing PM2.5 monitoring infrastructure cannot, however, be used to resolve variations in ambient PM2.5 centrations with adequate spatial and temporal density, or with adequate coverage of human time-activity patterns, such that the needs of modern exposure science and control can be met. Small, inexpensive, and portable devices, relying on newly available off-the-shelf sensors, may facilitate the creation of PM2.5 datasets with improved resolution and coverage, especially if many such devices can be deployed concurrently with low system cost.

Datasets generated with such technology could be used to overcome many important problems associated with exposure misclassification in air pollution epidemiology. Chapter 2 presents an epidemiological study of PM2.5 that used data from ambient monitoring stations in the Los Angeles basin to observe a decrease of 6.1 g (95\% CI: 3.5, 8.7) in population mean birthweight following in utero exposure to the Southern California wildfires of 2003, but was otherwise limited by the sparsity of the empirical basis for exposure assessment. Chapter 3 demonstrates technical potential for remedying PM2.5 monitoring deficiencies, beginning with the generation of low-cost yet useful estimates of hourly and daily PM2.5 concentrations at a regulatory monitoring site. The context (an urban neighborhood proximate to a major goods movement corridor) and the method (an off-the-shelf sensor costing approximately USD \$10, combined with other low-cost, open-source, readily available hardware) were selected to have special significance among researchers and practitioners affiliated with contemporary communities of practice in public health and citizen science. As operationalized by correlation with 1 h data from a Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) β-attenuation data, prototype instruments performed as well as commercially available equipment costing considerably more, and as well as another reference instrument under similar conditions at the same timescale (R2 ≈ 0.6). Correlations were stronger when 24 h integrating times were used instead (R2 = 0.72).

Chapter 4 replicates and extends the results of Chapter 3, showing that similar calibrations may be reasonably exchangeable between near-roadway and background monitoring sites. Chapter 4 also employs triplicate sensors to obtain data consistent with near-field ({\textless}50 m) observations of plumes from a major highway (I-880). At 1 minute timescales, maximum PM2.5 concentrations on the order of 100 μg m−3 to 200 μg m−3 were observed, commensurate with the magnitude of plumes from wildfires on longer timescales, as well as the magnitude of plumes that might be expected near other major highways on the same timescale. Finally, Chapter 4 quantifies variance among calibration parameters for a large sample of the sensors, as well as the error associated with the remote transfer of calibrations between two sufficiently large sets (± 10 \% for n = 12). These findings suggest that datasets generated with similar sensors could also improve upstream scientific understandings of fluxes resulting from indoor and outdoor emissions, atmospheric transformations, and transport, and may also facilitate timely and empirical verification of interventions to reduce emissions and exposures, in many important contexts (e.g., the provision of improved cookstoves; congestion pricing; mitigation policies attached to infill development; etc.). They also demonstrate that calibrations against continuous reference monitoring equipment could be remotely transferred, within practical tolerances, to reasonably sized and adequately resourced participatory monitoring campaigns, with minimal risk of disruption to existing monitoring infrastructure (i.e., established monitor- ing sites). Given a collaborator with a short window of access to a reference monitoring site, this would overcome a nominally important barrier associated with non-gravimetric, in-situ calibration of continuous PM2.5 monitors. Progressive and disruptive prospects linked to a proliferation of comparable sensing technologies based on commodity hardware are discussed in Chapter 5.},

The development and evaluation of more portable and affordable monitoring instruments based on low-cost sensors may offer a means to supplement and extend existing infrastructure, increasing the density and coverage of empirical measurements and thereby improving exposure science and control. Here, we report on field calibrations of a custom-built, battery-operated aerosol monitoring instrument we developed using low-cost, off-the-shelf optical aerosol sensors. We calibrated our instruments using 1 h and 24 h PM2.5 data from a class III US EPA Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) PM2.5 β-attenuation monitor in continuous operation at a regulatory monitoring site in Oakland, California. We observed negligible associations with ambient humidity and temperature; linear corrections were sufficient to explain 60\% of the variance in 1 h reference PM2.5 data and 72\% of the variance in 24 h data. Performance at 1 h integration times was comparable to commercially available optical instruments costing considerably more. These findings warrant further exploration of the circumstances under which this class of aerosol sensors may profitably be deployed to generate improved PM2.5 data sets.},

	abstract = {Regional new particle formation and growth events (NPEs) were observed on most days over the Sacramento and western Sierra foothills area of California in June 2010 during the Carbonaceous Aerosols and Radiative Effect Study (CARES). Simultaneous particle measurements at both the T0 (Sacramento, urban site) and the T1 (Cool, rural site located {\textasciitilde}40 km northeast of Sacramento) sites of CARES indicate that the NPEs usually occurred in the morning with the appearance of an ultrafine mode at {\textasciitilde}15 nm (in mobility diameter, Dm, measured by a mobility particle size spectrometer operating in the range 10-858 nm) followed by the growth of this modal diameter to {\textasciitilde}50 nm in the afternoon. These events were generally associated with southwesterly winds bringing urban plumes from Sacramento to the T1 site. The growth rate was on average higher at T0 (7.1 ± 2.7 nm h−1) than at T1 (6.2 ± 2.5 nm h−1), likely due to stronger anthropogenic influences at T0. Using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), we investigated the evolution of the size-resolved chemical composition of new particles at T1. Our results indicate that the growth of new particles was driven primarily by the condensation of oxygenated organic species and, to a lesser extent, ammonium sulfate. New particles appear to be fully neutralized during growth, consistent with high NH3 concentration in the region. Nitrogen-containing organic ions (i.e., CHN+, CH4N+, C2H3N+, and  C2H4N+) that are indicative of the presence of alkyl-amine species in submicrometer particles enhanced significantly during the NPE days, suggesting that amines might have played a role in these events. Our results also indicate that the bulk composition of the ultrafine mode organics during NPEs was very similar to that of anthropogenically influenced secondary organic aerosol (SOA) observed in transported urban plumes. In addition, the concentrations of species representative of urban emissions (e.g., black carbon, CO, NOx, and toluene) were significantly higher whereas the photo-oxidation products of biogenic VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and the biogenically influenced SOA also increased moderately during the NPE days compared to the non-event days. These results indicate that the frequently occurring NPEs over the Sacramento and Sierra Nevada regions were mainly driven by urban plumes from Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area, and that the interaction of regional biogenic emissions with the urban plumes has enhanced the new particle growth. This finding has important implications for quantifying the climate impacts of NPEs on global scale.},

This direct vertical column fitting (DVCF) algorithm allows more complete treatment of underlying algorithm physics compared to the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique, and enables more accurate accounting for the effects of spectral and altitude variations in NO2 measurement sensitivities. This DVCF algorithm and the stratosphere-troposphere separation scheme are applied to ultraviolet measurements from the Nadir Mapper of the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership spacecraft. The first results demonstrate the potential of OMPS for sensitive global monitoring of tropospheric NO2. Comparisons show good agreement with Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) tropospheric NO2 data, and that OMPS data have sufficient quality to continue and extend OMI NO2 data records.},

Studies have claimed that Rs decreased significantly more in urban areas than in rural areas from 1964 to 1989. However, these estimates have substantial biases because they ignored the spatial inhomogeneity of Rs measurements. To address this issue, we selected urban-rural station pairs collocated within 2°×2° and found 105 such pairs based on the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA). On average, the impact of urban aerosols on mean and trend of Rs is 0.2(0.7, median)±11.2 W m-2 and 0.1(-0.7, median)±6.6 W m-2 per decade from 1961 to 1990, respectively. Hence the averaged urban impacts on the mean and trend of Rs averaged over Europe, China and Japan from 1961 to 1990 are small although they may be significant at specific sites.},

Furthermore, secondary organic carbon (SOC) was calculated for the warm period of the year (April to October). The estimated SOC constituted about 75 ± 6\% of PM2.5 organic carbon in Athens, highlighting significant aging processes, at a regional scale. In the period 2011–2013 and during wintertime, an increase in OC and EC levels was observed, attributed to increase of wood burning for domestic heating due to the economic crisis.},

The aim of this work was to improve the knowledge about the emission factors of gas phase and particle-associated regulated and unregulated species from vehicle exhaust. Unregulated species such as black carbon (BC), primary organic aerosol (OA) content, particle number (PN), monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and a{\textasciitilde}selection of unregulated gaseous compounds, including nitrous acid (N2O), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), formaldehyde (HCHO), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and methane (CH4), were measured in real time with a suite of instruments including a high-resolution aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer, a resonance enhanced multi-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and a high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Diesel vehicles, without particle filters, featured the highest values for particle number, followed by gasoline vehicles and scooters. The particles from diesel and gasoline vehicles were mostly made of BC with a low fraction of OA, while the particles from the scooters were mainly composed of OA. Scooters were characterized by super high emissions factors for OA, which were orders of magnitude higher than for the other vehicles. The heavy duty diesel vehicle (HDDV) featured the highest nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, while the scooters had the highest emissions for total hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds due to the unburned and partially burned gasoline and lubricant oil mixture. Generally, vehicles fuelled with biodiesel blends showed lower emission factors of OA and total aromatics than those from the standard fuels. The scooters were the main emitters of aromatic compounds, followed by the gasoline vehicle, the diesel vehicles and the HDDV.},

	abstract = {Aerosol light scattering (σsp), backscattering  (σbsp) and absorption (σap)  were measured at Montsec (MSC; 42°3' N, 0°44' E, 1570 m a.s.l.), a remote high-altitude site in the western Mediterranean Basin. Mean (±SD) σsp, σbsp and σap were 18.9 ± 20.8, 2.6 ± 2.8 and 1.5 ± 1.4 Mm−1, respectively at 635 nm during the period under study (June 2011–June 2013). Mean values of single-scattering albedo (SSA, 635 nm), the scattering Ångström exponent (SAE, 450–635 nm), backscatter-to-scatter ratio (B / S, 635 nm), asymmetry parameter (g, 635 nm), black carbon mass absorption cross section (MAC, 637 nm) and PM2.5 mass scattering cross section (MSCS, 635 nm) were 0.92 ± 0.03, 1.56 ± 0.88, 0.16 ± 0.09, 0.53 ± 0.16, 10.9 ± 3.5 m2 g−1 and 2.5 ± 1.3 m2 g−1, respectively. The scattering measurements performed at MSC were in the medium/upper range of values reported by Andrews et al. (2011) for other mountaintop sites in Europe due to the frequent regional recirculation scenarios (SREG) and Saharan dust episodes (NAF) occurring mostly in spring/summer and causing the presence of polluted layers at the MSC altitude. However, the development of upslope winds and the possible presence of planetary boundary layer air at MSC altitude in summer may also have contributed to the high scattering observed. Under these summer conditions no clear diurnal cycles were observed for the measured extensive aerosol optical properties (σsp, σbsp  and σap). Conversely, low σsp and σap at MSC were measured during Atlantic advections (AA) and winter regional anticyclonic episodes (WREG) typically observed during the cold season in the western Mediterranean. Therefore, a season-dependent decrease in the magnitude of aerosol extensive properties was observed when MSC was in the free troposphere, with the highest free-troposphere vs. all-data difference observed in winter and the lowest in spring/summer. The location of MSC station allowed for a reliable characterization of aerosols as a function of the main synoptic meteorological patterns. The SAE was the lowest during NAF and showed an inverse correlation with the outbreak intensity, indicating a progressive shift toward larger particles. Moreover, the strength of NAF episodes in the region led to a slope of the scattering vs. absorption relationship among the lowest reported for other mountaintop sites worldwide, indicating that MSC was dominated by dust aerosols at high aerosol loading. As a consequence, SSA showed a nearly monotonic increase with increasing particle concentration and scattering. The SAE was the highest during SREG, indicating the presence of polluted layers dominated by smaller particles. Correspondingly, the asymmetry parameter was lower under SREG compared with NAF. The MAC and MSCS were significantly higher during NAF and SREG compared to AA and WREG, indicating an increase of absorption and scattering efficiencies associated with the summer polluted scenarios. The optical measurements performed at the MSC remote site were compared with those simultaneously performed at a regional background station in the western Mediterranean Basin located at around 700 m a.s.l. upstream of the MSC station.},

	abstract = {Long-range transport of black carbon (BC) is a growing concern as a result of the efficiency of BC in warming the climate and its adverse impact on human health. We study transpacific transport of BC during HIPPO-3 using a combination of inverse modeling and sensitivity analysis. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and its adjoint to constrain Asian BC emissions and estimate the source of BC over the North Pacific. We find that different sources of BC dominate the transport to the North Pacific during the southbound (29 March 2010) and northbound (13 April 2010) measurements in HIPPO-3. While biomass burning in Southeast Asia (SE) contributes about 60\% of BC in March, more than 90\% of BC comes from fossil fuel and biofuel combustion in East Asia (EA) during the April mission. GEOS-Chem simulations generally resolve the spatial and temporal variation of BC concentrations over the North Pacific, but are unable to reproduce the low and high tails of the observed BC distribution. We find that the optimized BC emissions derived from inverse modeling fail to improve model simulations significantly. This failure indicates that uncertainties in BC removal as well as transport, rather than in emissions, account for the major biases in GEOS-Chem simulations of BC over the North Pacific.
 The aging process, transforming BC from hydrophobic into hydrophilic form, is one of the key factors controlling wet scavenging and remote concentrations of BC. Sensitivity tests on BC aging (ignoring uncertainties of other factors controlling BC long range transport) suggest that in order to fit HIPPO-3 observations, the aging timescale of anthropogenic BC from EA may be several hours (faster than assumed in most global models), while the aging process of biomass burning BC from SE may occur much slower, with a timescale of a few days. To evaluate the effects of BC aging and wet deposition on transpacific transport of BC, we develop an idealized model of BC transport. We find that the mid-latitude air masses sampled during HIPPO-3 may have experienced a series of precipitation events, particularly near the EA and SE source region. Transpacific transport of BC is sensitive to BC aging when the aging rate is fast; this sensitivity peaks when the aging timescale is in the range of 1–1.5 d. Our findings indicate that BC aging close to the source must be simulated accurately at a process level in order to simulate better the global abundance and climate forcing of BC.},

	abstract = {Levoglucosan, a highly specific tracer of particulate matter from biomass burning, has been used to study the influence of residential wood burning, agricultural waste burning and Boreal forest fire emissions on the Arctic atmosphere black carbon (BC) concentration. A one-year time series from March 2008 to March 2009  of levoglucosan has been established at the Zeppelin observatory in the European Arctic. Elevated concentrations of levoglucosan in winter (mean: 1.02 ng m−3) compared to summer (mean: 0.13 ng m−3) were observed, resembling the seasonal variation seen for e.g. sulfate and BC. The mean concentration in the winter period was 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than typical values reported for European urban areas in winter, and 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than European rural background concentrations. Episodes of elevated levoglucosan concentration lasting from 1 to 6 days were more frequent in winter than in summer and peak values were higher, exceeding 10 ng m−3 at the most.
 Concentrations of elemental carbon from biomass burning (ECbb) were obtained by combining measured concentrations of levoglucosan and emission ratios of levoglucosan and EC for wildfires/agricultural fires and for residential wood burning. Neglecting chemical degradation by OH provides minimum levoglucosan concentrations, corresponding to a mean ECbb concentration of 3.7 ± 1.2 ng m−3 in winter (October–April) and 0.8 ± 0.3 ng m−3 in summer (May–September), or 8.8 ± 4.5\% of the measured equivalent black carbon (EBC) concentration in winter and 6.1 ± 3.4\% in summer. When accounting for chemical degradation of levoglucosan by OH, an upper estimate of 31–45\% of EBC could be attributed to ECbb* (ECbb adjusted for chemical degradation) in winter, whereas no reliable ({\textless}100\%) upper estimate could be provided for summer for the degradation rates applied. Hence, fossil fuel sources appear to dominate the European Arctic BC concentrations in winter, whereas the very wide range obtained for summer does not allow us to conclude upon this for the warm season.
 Calculations using the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART show that the seasonal variation of the modeled ECbb (ECbb,m) concentration compared relatively well with observationally derived ECbb from agricultural fires/wildfires during summer, and residential wood burning in winter. The model overestimates by a factor of 2.2 in winter and 4.4 in summer when compared to the observationally derived mean ECbb concentration, which provides the minimum estimate, whereas it underestimates by a factor of 2.3–3.3 in winter and a factor of 4.5 in summer when compared to ECbb*, which provides the upper estimate. There are indications of too-low emissions of residential wood burning in northern Russia, a region of great importance with respect to observed concentrations of BC in the European Arctic.},

	abstract = {Long-term PM2.5 exposure has been associated with various adverse health outcomes. However, most ground monitors are located in urban areas, leading to a potentially biased representation of true regional PM2.5 levels. To facilitate epidemiological studies, accurate estimates of the spatiotemporally continuous distribution of PM2.5 concentrations are important. Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been increasingly used for PM2.5 concentration estimation due to its comprehensive spatial coverage. Nevertheless, previous studies indicated that an inherent disadvantage of many AOD products is their coarse spatial resolution. For instance, the available spatial resolutions of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) AOD products are 10 and 17.6 km, respectively. In this paper, a new AOD product with 1 km spatial resolution retrieved by the multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm based on MODIS measurements was used. A two-stage model was developed to account for both spatial and temporal variability in the PM2.5–AOD relationship by incorporating the MAIAC AOD, meteorological fields, and land use variables as predictors. Our study area is in the southeastern US centered at the Atlanta metro area, and data from 2001 to 2010 were collected from various sources. The model was fitted annually, and we obtained model fitting R2 ranging from 0.71 to 0.85, mean prediction error (MPE) from 1.73 to 2.50 μg m−3, and root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) from 2.75 to 4.10 μg m−3. In addition, we found cross-validation R2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.78, MPE from 2.00 to 3.01 μg m−3, and RMSPE from 3.12 to 5.00 μg m−3, indicating a good agreement between the estimated and observed values. Spatial trends showed that high PM2.5 levels occurred in urban areas and along major highways, while low concentrations appeared in rural or mountainous areas. Our time-series analysis showed that, for the 10-year study period, the PM2.5 levels in the southeastern US have decreased by {\textasciitilde}20\%. The annual decrease has been relatively steady from 2001 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2010 while a significant drop occurred between 2007 and 2008. An observed increase in PM2.5 levels in year 2005 is attributed to elevated sulfate concentrations in the study area in warm months of 2005.},

Samples were collected using rotating drum impactors (RDIs) and subsequently analysed with synchrotron radiation-induced X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (SR-XRF). Quantification of kerb and urban increments (defined as kerb-to-urban and urban-to-rural concentration ratios, respectively), and assessment of diurnal and weekly variability provided insight into sources governing urban air quality and the effects of urban micro-environments on human exposure. Traffic-related elements yielded the highest kerb increments, with values in the range of 11.6 to 18.5 for SW winds (3.6–9.4 for NE) observed for elements influenced by brake wear (e.g. Cu, Sb, Ba) and 5.6 to 8.0 for SW (2.6–6.5 for NE) for other traffic-related processes (e.g.  Cr, Fe, Zn). Kerb increments for these elements were highest in the PM10−2.5 mass fraction, roughly 3 times that of the PM1.0−0.3 fraction. These elements also showed the highest urban increments (∼3.0), although no difference was observed between brake wear and other traffic-related elements. Traffic-related elements exhibited higher concentrations during morning and evening rush hour, and on weekdays compared to weekends, with the strongest trends observed at the kerbside site, and additionally enhanced by winds coming directly from the road, consistent with street canyon effects. Elements related to mineral dust (e.g. Al, Ca, Sr) showed significant influences from traffic-induced resuspension, as evidenced by moderate kerb (2.0–4.1 for SW, 1.4–2.1 for NE) and urban (1.7–2.3) increments and increased concentrations during peak traffic flow. Elements related to regional transport showed no significant enhancement at kerb or urban sites, with the exception of PM10−2.5 sea salt (factor of 1.5–2.0), which may be influenced by traffic-induced resuspension of sea and/or road salt. Heavy duty vehicles appeared to have a larger effect than passenger vehicles on the concentrations of all elements influenced by resuspension (including sea salt) and wearing processes. Trace element concentrations in London were influenced by both local and regional sources, with coarse and intermediate fractions dominated by traffic-induced resuspension and wearing processes and fine particles influenced by regional transport.},

The data provides the longest record of directly measured [BC] in the Arctic. The mean winter, spring, summer, and autumn [BC] based on the entire data set were 339, 199, 127, and 213 ng m-3, respectively. Annual mean [BC] decreased from {\textasciitilde}300 in {\textasciitilde}1970 to 82 ng m-3 in 2010. [BC] data sets from other Arctic sites show similar trends but concentrations at Kevo are generally higher. From {\textasciitilde}1970 to 2010 the [BC] decreased by {\textasciitilde}1.8\% per year. However, [BC] did not decrease monotonically. Instead, cyclical peaks occurred around 1976- 77, 1985-87, and 1999. During such periods, Nickel concentrations were well correlated with [BC]. This suggests that emissions from extensive ore smelting on the Kola Peninsula were significant contributors of particulate matter observed at Kevo. Simulations of [BC] at Kevo using the OsloCTM3 model using different emission inventories and meteorological data sets were performed. Modeled concentrations were lower than observed by a factor of four. The results indicated that circulation changes can explain year to year variability, but the downward trend in the observations is mostly explained by emissions. Emission inventories in Europe, Russia and the former Soviet Union are poorly constrained and appear to need revision in order to match observed trends in BC atmospheric concentrations.},

	abstract = {While the field of atmospheric organic aerosol scientific research has experienced thorough and insightful progress over the last half century, this progress has been accompanied by the evolution of a communicative and detailed yet, at times, complex and inconsistent language. The menagerie of detailed classification that now exists to describe organic compounds in our atmosphere reflects the wealth of observational techniques now at our disposal as well as the rich information provided by state-of-the-science instrumentation. However, the nomenclature in place to communicate these scientific gains is growing disjointed to the point that effective communication within the scientific community and to the public may be sacrificed. We propose standardizing a naming convention for organic aerosol classification that is relevant to laboratory studies, ambient observations, atmospheric models, and various stakeholders for air-quality problems. Because a critical aspect of this effort is to directly translate the essence of complex physico-chemical phenomena to a much broader, policy-oriented audience, we recommend a framework that maximizes comprehension among scientists and non-scientists alike. For example, to classify volatility, it relies on straightforward alphabetic terms (e.g., semivolatile, SV; intermediate volatility, IV; etc.) rather than possibly ambiguous numeric indices. This framework classifies organic material as primary or secondary pollutants and distinguishes among fundamental features important for science and policy questions including emission source, chemical phase, and volatility. Also useful is the addition of an alphabetic suffix identifying the volatility of the organic material or its precursor for when emission occurred. With this framework, we hope to introduce into the community a consistent connection between common notation for the general public and detailed nomenclature for highly specialized discussion. In so doing, we try to maintain consistency with historical, familiar naming schemes, unify much of the scattered nomenclature presented in recent literature, reduce the barrier of comprehension to outside audiences, and construct a scaffold into which insights from future scientific discoveries can be incorporated.},

	abstract = {In this study, global emissions of gases and particles from the transportation sector are projected from the year 2010 to 2050. The Speciated Pollutant Emission Wizard (SPEW)-Trend model, a dynamic model that links the emitter population to its emission characteristics, is used to project emissions from on-road vehicles and non-road engines. Unlike previous models of global emission estimates, SPEW-Trend incorporates considerable detail on the technology stock and builds explicit relationships between socioeconomic drivers and technological changes, such that the vehicle fleet and the vehicle technology shares change dynamically in response to economic development. Emissions from shipping, aviation, and rail are estimated based on other studies so that the final results encompass the entire transportation sector. The emission projections are driven by four commonly-used IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and B2). With global fossil-fuel use (oil and coal) in the transportation sector in the range of 128–171 EJ across the four scenarios, global emissions are projected to be 101–138 Tg of carbon monoxide (CO), 44–54 Tg of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 14–18 Tg of non-methane total hydrocarbons (THC), and 3.6–4.4 Tg of particulate matter (PM) in the year 2030. At the global level, a common feature of the emission scenarios is a projected decline in emissions during the first one or two decades (2010–2030), because the effects of stringent emission standards offset the growth in fuel use. Emissions increase slightly in some scenarios after 2030, because of the fast growth of on-road vehicles with lax or no emission standards in Africa and increasing emissions from non-road gasoline engines and shipping. On-road vehicles and non-road engines contribute the most to global CO and THC emissions, while on-road vehicles and shipping contribute the most to NOx and PM emissions. At the regional level, Latin America and East Asia are the two largest contributors to global CO and THC emissions in the year 2010; this dominance shifts to Africa and South Asia in the future. By the year 2050, for CO and THC emissions, non-road engines contribute the greatest fraction in Asia and the former USSR, while on-road vehicles make the largest contribution in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East; for NOx and PM emissions, shipping controls the trend in most regions. These forecasts include a formal treatment of the factors that drive technology choices in the global vehicle sector and therefore represent a robust and plausible projection of what future emissions may be. These results have important implications for emissions of gases and aerosols that influence air quality, human health, and climate change.},

	abstract = {Understanding the sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is essential for ground-level ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) abatement measures. We made VOC measurements at 27 sites and online observations at an urban site in Beijing from July 2009 to January 2012. Based on these measurement data, we determined the spatial and temporal distribution of VOCs, estimated their annual emission strengths based on their emission ratios relative to carbon monoxide (CO), and quantified the relative contributions of various sources using the chemical mass balance (CMB) model. These results from ambient measurements were compared with existing emission inventories to evaluate the spatial distribution, species-specific emissions, and source structure of VOCs in Beijing. The measured VOC distributions revealed a hotspot in the southern suburban area of Beijing, whereas current emission inventories suggested that VOC emissions were concentrated in downtown areas. Compared with results derived from ambient measurements, the annual inventoried emissions of oxygenated VOC (OVOC) species and C2–C4 alkanes may be underestimated, while the emissions of styrene and 1,3-butadiene may be overestimated by current inventories. Source apportionment using the CMB model identified vehicular exhaust as the most important VOC source, with the relative contribution of 49\%, in good agreement with the 40–51\% estimated by emission inventories. The relative contribution of paint and solvent utilization obtained from the CMB model was 14\%, significantly lower than the value of 32\% reported by one existing inventory. Meanwhile, the relative contribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage calculated using the CMB model was 6\%, whereas LPG usage contribution was not reported by current emission inventories. These results suggested that VOC emission strengths in southern suburban area of Beijing, annual emissions of C2–C4 alkanes, OVOCs and some alkenes, and the contributions of solvent and paint utilization and LPG usage in current inventories all require significant revisions.},

	abstract = {As an alternative transportation fuel to petrodiesel, biodiesel has been promoted within national energy portfolio targets across the world. Early estimations of low lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of biodiesel were a driver behind extensive government support in the form of financial incentives for the industry. However, studies consistently report a high degree of uncertainty in these emissions estimates, raising questions concerning the carbon benefits of biodiesel. Furthermore, the implications of feedstock blending on GHG emissions uncertainty have not been explicitly addressed despite broad practice by the industry to meet fuel quality standards and to control costs. This work investigated the impact of feedstock blending on the characteristics of biodiesel by using a chance-constrained (CC) blend optimization method. The objective of the optimization is minimization of feedstock costs subject to fuel standards and emissions constraints. Results indicate that blending can be used to manage GHG emissions uncertainty characteristics of biodiesel, and to achieve cost reductions through feedstock diversification. Simulations suggest that emissions control policies that restrict the use of certain feedstocks based on their GHG estimates overlook blending practices and benefits, increasing the cost of biodiesel. In contrast, emissions control policies which recognize the multifeedstock nature of biodiesel provide producers with feedstock selection flexibility, enabling them to manage their blend portfolios cost effectively, potentially without compromising fuel quality or emissions reductions.},

However, studies outside North America have been limited due to the lack of ground PM2.5 measurements to calibrate the model. Taking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we developed a national-scale geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in China with fused satellite AOD as the primary predictor. The results showed that the meteorological and land use information can greatly improve model performance. The overall cross-validation (CV) R2 is 0.64 and root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) is 32.98 ?g/m3. The mean prediction error (MPE) of the predicted annual PM2.5 is 8.28 ?g/m3. Our predicted annual PM2.5 concentrations indicated that over 96\% of the Chinese population lives in areas that exceed the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (CNAAQS) Level 2 standard. Our results also confirmed satellite-derived AOD in conjunction with meteorological fields and land use information can be successfully applied to extend the ground PM2.5 monitoring network in China.},

	abstract = {Ambient air monitoring as part of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA's) Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) currently uses filter packs to measure weekly integrated concentrations. The US EPA is interested in supplementing CASTNet with semi-continuous monitoring systems at select sites to characterize atmospheric chemistry and deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds at higher time resolution than the filter pack. The Monitor for AeRosols and GAses in ambient air (MARGA) measures water-soluble gases and aerosols at an hourly temporal resolution. The performance of the MARGA was assessed under the US EPA Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The assessment was conducted in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, from 8 September to 8 October 2010 and focused on gaseous SO2, HNO3, and NH3 and aerosol SO42-, NO3-,  and NH4+. Precision of the MARGA was evaluated by calculating the median absolute relative percent difference (MARPD) between paired hourly results from duplicate MARGA units (MUs), with a performance goal of ≤ 25\%. The accuracy of the MARGA was evaluated by calculating the MARPD for each MU relative to the average of the duplicate denuder/filter pack concentrations, with a performance goal of ≤ 40\%. Accuracy was also evaluated by using linear regression, where MU concentrations were plotted against the average of the duplicate denuder/filter pack concentrations. From this, a linear least squares line of best fit was applied. The goal was for the slope of the line of best fit to be between 0.8 and 1.2. The MARGA performed well in comparison to the denuder/filter pack for SO2, SO42−,  and NH4+, with all three compounds passing the accuracy and precision goals by a significant margin. The performance of the MARGA in measuring NO3- could not be evaluated due to the different sampling efficiency of coarse NO3- by the MUs and the filter pack. Estimates of "fine" NO3- were calculated for the MUs and the filter pack. Using this and results from a previous study, it is concluded that if the MUs and the filter pack were sampling the same particle size, the MUs would have good agreement in terms of precision and accuracy. The MARGA performed moderately well in measuring HNO3 and NH3, though neither met the linear regression slope goals. However, recommendations for improving the measurement of HNO3 and NH3 are discussed. It is concluded that SO42-, SO2, NO3-,  HNO3, NH4+, and NH3 concentrations can be measured with acceptable accuracy and precision when the MARGA is operated in conjunction with the recommendations outlined in the manuscript.},

	abstract = {Biogenic NOx emissions from soils are a large natural source with substantial uncertainties in global bottom-up estimates (ranging from 4 to 27 Tg N yr−1). We reduce this range in emission estimates, and present a top-down soil NOx emission inventory for 2005 based on retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We used a state-of-science soil NOx emission inventory (Hudman et al., 2012) as a priori in the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model to identify 11 regions where tropospheric NO2 columns are dominated by soil NOx emissions. Strong correlations between soil NOx emissions and simulated NO2 columns indicated that spatial patterns in simulated NO2 columns in these regions indeed reflect the underlying soil NOx emissions. Subsequently, we used a mass-balance approach to constrain emissions for these 11 regions on all major continents using OMI observed and GEOS-Chem simulated tropospheric NO2 columns. We found that responses of simulated NO2 columns to changing NOx emissions were suppressed over low NOx regions, and accounted for these non-linearities in our inversion approach. In general, our approach suggests that emissions need to be increased in most regions. Our OMI top-down soil NOx inventory amounts to 10.0 Tg N for 2005 when only constraining the 11 regions, and 12.9 Tg N when extrapolating the constraints globally. Substantial regional differences exist (ranging from −40\% to +90\%), and globally our top-down inventory is 4–35\% higher than the GEOS-Chem a priori (9.6 Tg N yr−1). We evaluated NO2 concentrations simulated with our new OMI top-down inventory against surface NO2 measurements from monitoring stations in Africa, the USA, and Europe.  Although this comparison is complicated by several factors, we find an encouraging improved agreement when using the OMI top-down inventory compared to using the a priori inventory. To our knowledge, this study provides, for the first time, specific constraints on soil NOx emissions on all major continents using OMI NO2 columns. Our results rule out the high end of reported soil NOx emission estimates, and suggest that global emissions are most likely around 10–13 Tg N yr−1.},

During these events, peaks in the concentration of intermediate and large ions were followed by peaks in the concentration of ammonium and sulfate, which were not observed in the organic fraction. Comparison of days with and without particle formation events revealed that ammonium and sulfate were the dominant species on particle formation days while high concentrations of biomass burning OA inhibited particle growth. Analyses of the degree of particle neutralization lead us to conclude that an excess of ammonium enabled particle formation and growth. In addition, the large ion concentration increased sharply during particle growth, suggesting that during nucleation the neutral gaseous species ammonia and sulfuric acid react to form ammonium and sulfate ions. Overall, we conclude that the mechanism of particle formation and growth involved ammonia and sulfuric acid, with limited input from organics.},

This hybrid approach enhances RM results by providing initial estimates of source impacts from a much larger number of sources than are typically used in RMs, and provides source–receptor relationships for secondary species. Further, the method addresses issues of source collinearities and accounts for emissions uncertainties. We apply this hybrid approach to conduct PM2.5 source apportionment at Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) sites across the US. Ambient PM2.5 concentrations at these receptor sites were apportioned to 33 separate sources. Hybrid method results led to large changes of impacts from CTM estimates for sources such as dust, woodstoves, and other biomass-burning sources, but limited changes to others. The refinements reduced the differences between CTM-simulated and observed concentrations of individual PM2.5 species by over 98\% when using a weighted least-squares error minimization. The rankings of source impacts changed from the initial estimates, further demonstrating that CTM-only results should be evaluated with observations. Assessment with RM results at six US locations showed that the hybrid results differ somewhat from commonly resolved sources. The hybrid method also resolved sources that typical RM methods do not capture without extra measurement information for unique tracers. The method can be readily applied to large domains and long (such as multi-annual) time periods to provide source impact estimates for management- and health-related studies.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the evolution of ship-emitted aerosol particles using the stochastic particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC (Particle Monte Carlo model-Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry). Comparisons of our results with observations from the QUANTIFY (Quantifying the Climate Impact of Global and European Transport Systems) study in 2007 in the English Channel and the Gulf of Biscay showed that the model was able to reproduce the observed evolution of total number concentration and the vanishing of the nucleation mode consisting of sulfate particles. Further process analysis revealed that during the first hour after emission, dilution reduced the total number concentration by four orders of magnitude, while coagulation reduced it by an additional order of magnitude. Neglecting coagulation resulted in an overprediction of more than one order of magnitude in the number concentration of particles smaller than 40 nm at a plume age of 100 s. Coagulation also significantly altered the mixing state of the particles, leading to a continuum of internal mixtures of sulfate and black carbon. The impact on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations depended on the supersaturation threshold S at which CCN activity was evaluated. For the base case conditions, characterized by a low formation rate of secondary aerosol species, neglecting coagulation, but simulating condensation, led to an underestimation of CCN concentrations of about 37\% for S = 0.3\% at the end of the 14-h simulation. In contrast, for supersaturations higher than 0.7\%, neglecting coagulation resulted in an overestimation of CCN concentration, about 75\% for S = 1\%. For S lower than 0.2\% the differences between simulations including coagulation and neglecting coagulation were negligible. Neglecting condensation, but simulating coagulation did not impact the CCN concentrations below 0.2\% and resulted in an underestimation of CCN concentrations for larger supersaturations, e.g., 18\% for S = 0.6\%. We also explored the role of nucleation for the CCN concentrations in the ship plume. For the base case the impact of nucleation on CCN concentrations was limited, but for a sensitivity case with higher formation rates of secondary aerosol over several hours, the CCN concentrations increased by an order of magnitude for supersaturation thresholds above 0.3\%.},

Fixed-site monitors have been shown to be largely inadequate for representing concentrations at nearby locations, resulting in the increasing use of spatial modelling or mobile sampling methods to achieve spatial saturation. In this study, we employ the use of a simple bicycle to sample concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM10) at two small areas (\&lt; 2.5 km2) in South Auckland, New Zealand. Portable instruments were mounted inside a custom-built casing at the front of the bicycle and every street within each study area was sampled in a grid-like fashion, at four times of day (07:00, 12:00, 17:00 and 22:00). Each area has a six-lane highway running through its centre and the core aim was to visualise and describe spatial variability of pollutant levels about the highway, main arterials and quieter streets, at periods of contrasting meteorological and traffic conditions. A total of 20 sampling runs in each area (five at each of the four timings) were conducted. Meteorological data were logged continuously at background sites within each study area. Results show that the influence of highway traffic (UFPs, CO) was strongest during the mornings and late evenings when wind speeds were low, while for the midday and afternoon timings, concentrations were highest at the arterial and shopping zones. Concentrations of PM10 appeared to be strongest in the residential areas during mornings and late evenings, suggesting an influence of wood burning for home heating. For all timings combined, for all three pollutants, it appears the arterial roads featuring shops and numerous intersections with traffic lights, had a stronger influence on concentrations than the busier but more free-flowing highways. This study provides not only an insight into microspatial hotspot variation across suburbs, but also how this variation shifts diurnally.},

	abstract = {Environmental chamber ("smog chamber") experiments were conducted to investigate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production from dilute emissions from two medium-duty diesel vehicles (MDDVs) and three heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) under urban-like conditions. Some of the vehicles were equipped with emission control aftertreatment devices, including diesel particulate filters (DPFs), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs). Experiments were also performed with different fuels (100\% biodiesel and low-, medium- or high-aromatic ultralow sulfur diesel) and driving cycles (Unified Cycle,{\textasciitilde}Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and creep + idle). During normal operation, vehicles with a catalyzed DPF emitted very little primary particulate matter (PM). Furthermore, photooxidation of dilute emissions from these vehicles produced essentially no SOA (below detection limit). However, significant primary PM emissions and SOA production were measured during active DPF regeneration experiments. Nevertheless, under reasonable assumptions about DPF regeneration frequency, the contribution of regeneration emissions to the total vehicle emissions is negligible, reducing PM trapping efficiency by less than 2\%. Therefore, catalyzed DPFs appear to be very effective in reducing both primary PM emissions and SOA production from diesel vehicles. For both MDDVs and HDDVs without aftertreatment substantial SOA formed in the smog chamber – with the emissions from some vehicles generating twice as much SOA as primary organic aerosol after 3 h of oxidation at typical urban VOC / NOx ratios (3 : 1). Comprehensive organic gas speciation was performed on these emissions, but less than half of the measured SOA could be explained by traditional (speciated) SOA precursors. The remainder presumably originates from the large fraction ({\textasciitilde}30\%) of the nonmethane organic gas emissions that could not be speciated using traditional one-dimensional gas chromatography. The unspeciated organics – likely comprising less volatile species such as intermediate volatility organic compounds – appear to be important SOA precursors; we estimate that the effective SOA yield (defined as the ratio of SOA mass to reacted precursor mass) was 9 ± 6\% if both speciated SOA precursors and unspeciated organics are included in the analysis. SOA production from creep + idle operation was 3–4 times larger than SOA production from the same vehicle operated over the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). Fuel properties had little or no effect on primary PM emissions or SOA formation.},

	abstract = {The effects of photochemical aging on emissions from 15 light-duty gasoline vehicles were investigated using a smog chamber to probe the critical link between the tailpipe and ambient atmosphere. The vehicles were recruited from the California in-use fleet;  they represent a wide range of model years (1987 to 2011), vehicle types and emission control technologies. Each vehicle was tested on a chassis dynamometer using the unified cycle. Dilute emissions were sampled into a portable smog chamber and then photochemically aged under urban-like conditions. For every vehicle, substantial secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation occurred during cold-start tests, with the emissions from some vehicles generating as much as 6 times the amount of SOA as primary particulate matter (PM) after 3 h of oxidation inside the chamber at typical atmospheric oxidant levels (and 5 times the amount of SOA as primary PM after 5 × 106 molecules cm−3 h of OH exposure). Therefore, the contribution of light-duty gasoline vehicle exhaust to ambient PM levels is likely dominated by secondary PM production (SOA and nitrate). Emissions from hot-start tests formed about a factor of 3–7 less SOA than cold-start tests. Therefore, catalyst warm-up appears to be an important factor in controlling SOA precursor emissions. The mass of SOA generated by photooxidizing exhaust from newer (LEV2) vehicles was a factor of 3 lower than that formed from exhaust emitted by older (pre-LEV) vehicles, despite much larger reductions (a factor of 11–15) in nonmethane organic gas emissions. These data suggest that a complex and nonlinear relationship exists between organic gas emissions and SOA formation, which is not surprising since SOA precursors are only one component of the exhaust. Except for the oldest (pre-LEV) vehicles, the SOA production could not be fully explained by the measured oxidation of speciated (traditional) SOA precursors. Over the timescale of these experiments, the mixture of organic vapors emitted by newer vehicles appears to be more efficient (higher yielding) in producing SOA than the emissions from older vehicles. About 30\% of the nonmethane organic gas emissions from the newer (LEV1 and LEV2) vehicles could not be speciated, and the majority of the SOA formed from these vehicles appears to be associated with these unspeciated organics. By comparing this study with a companion study of diesel trucks, we conclude that both primary PM emissions and SOA production for light-duty gasoline vehicles are much greater than for late-model (2007 and later) on-road heavy-duty diesel trucks.},

	abstract = {The changes in precipitation in north-eastern North America caused by chemistry – and particularly anthropogenic aerosols – are investigated using the Weather Research Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF/Chem v3.2) model. The simulations were carried out for a five-month period from April to August 2009. The model results show that non-negligible changes in both convective and cloud-resolved (non-convective) precipitation are caused by chemistry and/or aerosols over most parts of the domain. The changes can be attributed to both radiative and microphysical interactions with the meteorology. A chemistry-induced change of approximately −15\% is found in the five-month mean daily convective precipitation over areas with high convective rain; most of this can be traced to radiative effects. Total convective rain is greater than total non-convective rain in the domain, but a chemistry-induced increase of about 30\% is evident in the five-month mean daily non-convective precipitation over the heavily urbanized parts of the Atlantic coast. The effects of aerosols on cloud microphysics and precipitation were examined for two particle size ranges, 0.039–0.1 μm and 1–2.5 μm, representing the nucleation and accumulation modes respectively. Strongly positive spatial correlation between cloud droplet number and non-convective rain are found for activated (cloud-borne) aerosols in both size ranges. Non-activated (interstitial) aerosols have a positive correlation with cloud droplet number and non-convective rain when they are small and an inverse correlation for larger sizes.},

	abstract = {A series of smog chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the transformation of primary organic aerosol (POA) and formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) during the photooxidation of dilute exhaust from a fleet of gasoline and diesel motor vehicles and two gas-turbine engines. In experiments where POA was present in the chamber at the onset of photooxidation, positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to determine separate POA and SOA factors from aerosol mass spectrometer data. A 2-factor solution, with one POA factor and one SOA factor, was sufficient to describe the organic aerosol for gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, and one of the gas-turbine engines. Experiments with the second gas-turbine engine required a 3-factor PMF solution with a POA factor and two SOA factors. Results from the PMF analysis were compared to the residual method for determining SOA and POA mass concentrations. The residual method apportioned a larger fraction of the organic aerosol mass as POA because it assumes that all mass at m / z 57 is associated with POA. The POA mass spectrum for the gasoline and diesel vehicles exhibited high abundances of the CnH2n+1 series of ions (m / z 43, 57, etc.) and was similar to the mass spectra of the hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol factor determined from ambient data sets with one exception, a diesel vehicle equipped with a diesel oxidation catalyst. POA mass spectra for the gas-turbine engines are enriched in the CnH2n−1 series of ions (m / z 41, 55, etc.), consistent with the composition of the lubricating oil used in these engines. The SOA formed from the three sources exhibits high abundances of m / z 44 and 43, indicative of mild oxidation. The SOA mass spectra are consistent with less-oxidized ambient SV-OOA (semivolatile oxygenated organic aerosols) and fall within the triangular  region of f44 versus f43 defined by ambient measurements. However there is poor absolute agreement between the experimentally derived SOA mass spectra and ambient OOA factors, though this poor agreement should be expected based on the variability of ambient OOA factors. Van Krevelen analysis of the POA and SOA factors for gasoline and diesel experiments reveal slopes of −0.50 and −0.40, respectively. This suggests that the oxidation chemistry in these experiments is a combination of carboxylic acid and alcohol/peroxide formation, consistent with ambient oxidation chemistry.},

	abstract = {A convective parameterization is described and evaluated that may be used in high resolution non-hydrostatic mesoscale models as well as in modeling system with unstructured varying grid resolutions and for convection aware simulations. This scheme is based on a stochastic approach originally implemented by Grell and Devenyi (2002). Two approaches are tested on resolutions ranging from 20 km to 5 km. One approach is based on spreading subsidence to neighboring grid points, the other one on a recently introduced method by Arakawa et al. (2011). Results from model intercomparisons, as well as verification with observations indicate that both the spreading of the subsidence and Arakawa's approach work well for the highest resolution runs. Because of its simplicity and its capability for an automatic smooth transition as the resolution is increased, Arakawa's approach may be preferred. Additionally, interactions with aerosols have been implemented through a cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) dependent autoconversion of cloud water to rain as well as an aerosol dependent evaporation of cloud drops. Initial tests with this newly implemented aerosol approach show plausible results with a decrease in predicted precipitation in some areas, caused by the changed autoconversion mechanism. This change also causes a significant increase of cloud water and ice detrainment near the cloud tops. Some areas also experience an increase of precipitation, most likely caused by strengthened downdrafts.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4058},
	abstract = {In this study, we describe how WRF-Sfire is coupled with WRF-Chem to construct WRFSC, an integrated forecast system for wildfire and smoke prediction. The integrated forecast system has the advantage of not requiring a simple plume-rise model and assumptions about the size and heat release from the fire in order to determine fire emissions into the atmosphere. With WRF-Sfire, wildfire spread, plume and plume-top heights are predicted directly, at every WRF timestep, providing comprehensive meteorology and fire emissions to the chemical transport model WRF-Chem. Evaluation of WRFSC was based on comparisons between available observations to the results of two WRFSC simulations. The study found overall good agreement between forecasted and observed fire spread and smoke transport for the Witch-Guejito fire. Also the simulated PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) peak concentrations matched the observations. However, the NO and ozone levels were underestimated in the simulations and the peak concentrations were mistimed. Determining the terminal or plume-top height is one of the most important aspects of simulating wildfire plume transport, and the study found overall good agreement between simulated and observed plume-top heights, with some (10\% or less) underestimation by the simulations. One of the most promising results of the study was the agreement between passive-tracer modeled plume-top heights for the Barker Canyon fire simulation and observations. This simulation took only 13h, with the first 24h forecast ready in almost 3h, making it a possible operational tool for providing emission profiles for external chemical transport models.},

	abstract = {The smelter industry in Kola Peninsula is the largest source of anthropogenic SO2 in the Arctic part of Europe and one of the largest within the Arctic domain. Due to socio-economic changes in Russia, the emissions have been decreasing especially since the late 1990s resulting in decreased SO2 concentrations close to Kola in eastern Lapland, Finland. At the same time, the frequency of new particle formation days has been decreasing distinctively at SMEAR I station in eastern Lapland, especially during spring and autumn. We show that sulfur species, namely sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid, have an important role in both new particle formation and subsequent growth and that the decrease in new particle formation days is a result of the reduction of sulfur emissions originating from Kola Peninsula. In addition to sulfur species, there are many other quantities, such as formation rate of aerosol particles, condensation sink and nucleation mode particle number concentration, which are related to the number of observed new particle formation (NPF) days and need to be addressed when linking sulfur emissions and NPF. We show that while most of these quantities exhibit statistically significant trends, the reduction in Kola sulfur emissions is the most obvious reason for the rapid decline in NPF days. Sulfuric acid explains approximately 20–50\% of the aerosol condensational growth observed at SMEAR I, and there is a large seasonal variation with highest values obtained during spring and autumn. We found that (i) particles form earlier after sunrise during late winter and early spring due to high concentrations of SO2 and H2SO4; (ii) several events occurred during the absence of light, and they were connected to higher than average concentrations of SO2; and (iii) high SO2 concentrations could advance the onset of nucleation by several hours. Moreover, air masses coming over Kola Peninsula seemed to favour new particle formation.},

	abstract = {For the investigation of megacity emission plume characteristics mobile aerosol and trace gas measurements were carried out in the greater Paris region in July 2009 and January/February 2010 within the EU FP7 MEGAPOLI project. The deployed instruments measured physical and chemical properties of sub-micron aerosol particles, gas phase constituents of relevance for urban air pollution studies and meteorological parameters. The emission plume was identified based on fresh pollutant (e.g. particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, black carbon, CO2 and NOx) concentration changes in combination with wind direction data. The classification into megacity influenced and background air masses allowed a characterization of the emission plume during summer and winter environmental conditions. On average, a clear increase of fresh pollutant concentrations in plume compared to background air masses was found for both seasons. For example, an average increase of 190\% (+8.8 ng m−3) in summer and of 130\% (+18.1 ng m−3) in winter was found for particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in plume air masses. The aerosol particle size distribution in plume air masses was influenced by nucleation and growth due to coagulation and condensation in summer, while in winter only the second process seemed to be initiated by urban pollution.  The observed distribution of fresh pollutants in the emission plume – its cross sectional Gaussian-like profile and the exponential decrease of pollutant concentrations with increasing distance to the megacity – are in agreement with model results. Differences between model and measurements were found for plume center location, plume width and axial plume extent. In general, dilution was identified as the dominant process determining the axial variations within the Paris emission plume. For in-depth analysis of transformation processes occurring in the advected plume, simultaneous measurements at a suburban measurement site and a stationary site outside the metropolitan area using the mobile laboratory have proven to be most useful. Organic aerosol oxidation was observed in summer, while in winter transformation processes seemed to occur at a slower rate.},

	abstract = {We used the nested grid version of the global three-dimensional Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to examine the interannual variations (IAVs) of aerosols over heavily polluted regions in China for years 2004–2012. The role of variations in meteorological parameters was quantified by a simulation with fixed anthropogenic emissions at year 2006 levels and changes in meteorological parameters over 2004–2012. Simulated PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less) aerosol concentrations exhibited large IAVs in North China (NC, 32–42° N, 110–120° E), with regionally averaged absolute percent departure from the mean (APDM) values of 17, 14, 14, and 11\% in December-January-February (DJF), March-April-May (MAM), June-July-August (JJA), and September-October-November (SON), respectively. Over South China (SC, 22–32° N, 110–120° E), the IAVs in PM2.5 were found to be the largest in JJA, with the regional mean APDM values of 14\% in JJA and of about 9\% in other seasons. Concentrations of PM2.5 over the Sichuan Basin (SCB, 27–33° N, 102–110° E) were simulated to have the smallest IAVs among the polluted regions examined in this work, with the APDM values of 8–9\% in all seasons. All aerosol species (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, and organic carbon) were simulated to have the largest IAVs over NC in DJF, corresponding to the large variations in meteorological parameters over NC in this season.  Process analyses were performed to identify the key meteorological parameters that determined the IAVs of different aerosol species in different regions. While the variations in temperature and specific humidity, which influenced the gas-phase formation of sulfate, jointly determined the IAVs of sulfate over NC in both DJF and JJA, wind (or convergence of wind) in DJF and precipitation in JJA were the dominant meteorological factors to influence IAVs of sulfate over SC and the SCB. The IAVs in temperature and specific humidity influenced gas-to-aerosol partitioning, which were the major factors that led to the IAVs of nitrate aerosol in China. The IAVs in wind and precipitation were found to drive the IAVs of organic carbon aerosol. We also compared the IAVs of aerosols simulated with variations in meteorological parameters alone with those simulated with variations in both meteorological parameters and anthropogenic emissions; the variations in meteorological fields were found to dominate the IAVs of aerosols in China.},

A comprehensive comparison between monthly average model results and available measurements yielded Pearson correlation coefficients (R) ≥0.8 at ≥5 sites (out of a total of eight) for elemental carbon (EC) and nine trace elements: potassium, chromium, zinc, iron, titanium, arsenic, calcium, manganese, and strontium in the PM2.5 size fraction. Longer averaging time increased the overall R for PM2.5 EC from 0.89 (1 day) to 0.94 (1 month), and increased the number of species with strong correlations at individual sites. Predicted PM0.1 mass and PM0.1 EC exhibited excellent agreement with measurements (R = 0.92 and 0.94, respectively). The additional temporal and spatial information in the UCD\_P model predictions produced population exposure estimates for PM2.5 and PM0.1that differed from traditional exposure estimates based on information at monitoring locations in California Metropolitan Statistical Areas, with a maximum divergence of 58\% at Bakersfield. The UCD\_P model has the potential to improve exposure estimates in epidemiology studies of PM trace chemical components and health.},

	abstract = {A climatology of new particle formation (NPF) events at high altitude in the subtropical North Atlantic is presented. A 4-year data set (June 2008–June 2012), which includes number size distributions (10–600 nm), reactive gases (SO2, NOx, and O3), several components of solar radiation and meteorological parameters, measured at Izaña Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) observatory (2373 m above sea level; Tenerife, Canary Islands) was analysed. NPF is associated with the transport of gaseous precursors from the boundary layer by orographic buoyant upward flows that perturb the low free troposphere during daytime. On average, 30\% of the days contained an NPF event. Mean values of the formation and growth rates during the study period were 0.46 cm−3 s−1 and 0.42 nm h−1, correspondingly. There is a clearly marked NPF season (May–August), when these events account for 50–60\% of the days per month. Monthly mean values of the formation and growth rates exhibit higher values in this season, 0.49–0.92 cm−3 s−1 and 0.48–0.58 nm h−1, respectively. During NPF events, SO2, UV radiation and upslope winds showed higher values than during non-events. The overall data set indicates that SO2 plays a key role as precursor, although other species seem to contribute during some periods. Condensation of sulfuric acid vapour accounts for most of the measured particle growth during most of the year ({\textasciitilde}70\%), except for some periods. In May, the highest mean growth rates ({\textasciitilde}0.6 nm h−1) and the lowest contribution of sulfuric acid ({\textasciitilde}13\%) were measured, suggesting a significant involvement of other condensing vapours. The SO2 availability seems also to be the most influencing parameter in the year-to-year variability in the frequency of NPF events. The condensation sink showed similar features to other mountain sites, showing high values during NPF events. Summertime observations, when Izaña is within the Saharan Air Layer, suggest that dust particles may play a significant role acting as coagulation sink of freshly formed nucleation particles. The contribution of dust particles to the condensation sink of sulfuric acid vapours seems to be modest ({\textasciitilde}8\% as average). Finally, we identified a set of NPF events in which two nucleation modes, which may evolve at different rates, occur simultaneously and for which further investigations are necessary.},

	abstract = {Scales of spatial variability of black carbon (BC) aerosol plumes are quantified during the HIPPO aircraft campaign, which flew multiple missions from pole-to-pole over the Pacific ocean. During the first three missions of HIPPO, over 400 vertical profiles of BC concentrations were obtained using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). In this work, a total of 100 plumes are identified and analyzed. Due to the nature of the HIPPO flight track, the plume length scale is defined along the slanted flight track, having both vertical and horizontal components. These plumes comprise 57\% of the total BC mass measured and have a median scale of 113 km. An analysis of BC variability based on autocorrelation functions confirms that most of BC's variability exists on scales similar to the majority of measured plume scales, with a range of 85–155 km. The plume scales are compared to an effective along-track global circulation model (GCM) resolution, which ranges from 20 km for low altitudes and steep ascents to 230 km for high altitudes and shallower ascents. The results suggest that plumes characterized predominantly by their horizontal variation at these scales are too small to be captured by GCMs running at resolutions currently suitable for climate simulations.},

	abstract = {The level of air quality in urban centres is affected by emission of several pollutants, mainly coming from the vehicles flowing in their road networks. This is a well known phenomenon that influences the quality of life of people. Despite the deep concern of researchers and technicians, we are far from a total understanding of this phenomenon. On the contrary, the availability of reliable forecasting models would constitute an important tool for administrators in order of assessing suitable actions concerning the transportation policies, public as well private. Referring to the situation of the running fleet and the measured pollutant concentrations concerning the Italian town of Palermo, a data-deduced traffic model is here derived, its truthfulness being justified by a fuzzyfication of the phenomenon. A first validation of the model is supplied by utilising the emissions characteristics and the pollutant concentrations referring to a two years period of time. This work could represent a first attempt in defining a new approach to the problem of the pollution of the urban contexts, in order of providing administrators with a reliable and easier tool.},

	abstract = {The Multi-plume Aerosol dynamics and Transport (MAT) model has been developed to study the dynamics of the particle size distribution in urban environments. The MAT model uses a novel multi-plume scheme for vertical dispersion and routines of the aerodynamics models AERO3. It treats the processes: emission from a near ground source, dilution with background air, deposition, coagulation and condensation. The employed plume approach is computationally efficient compared to grid models and is therefore suitable for calculating longer time series.
The treatment of the different processes in the model was validated against analytical solutions and literature data and later the full model was applied to a field data set from the Copenhagen area. The range of changes in particle concentration including all processes compared to an inert treatment of particles lies between 13\% and 23\% of loss in total number concentration and 2\% loss and 8\% gain for the total volume concentration. This agrees well with measurements in Copenhagen that indicated total number concentration (ToN) losses in the range of 15-30\% between kerbside and urban rooftop level. The model also reproduces the shift of the maximum in the size distribution to slightly larger diameters between street and urban rooftop level.
Because of the uncertainties in the parameters describing the different processes and their similar influence on the particle size distribution, it is possible to obtain similar results with different parameter combinations. More research and model validation is needed to narrow the range of possible input parameters and model assumptions for this type of modelling.},

The particles were photochemically aged using the own volatile organic carbon emissions from the burnt wood.

The freshly emitted soot particles have a fractal-like structure.

The hygroscopicity parameter “apparent κ ” of fresh wood combustion particles varies between 0 and 0.39. With aging, the hygroscopicity of the particles generally increases. This is due to the uptake of organic matter and inorganic salts, and because the particles become more oxidized.

One smoldering phase experiment was carried out, which, in contrast to the other experiments, showed very high apparent κ values between 0.2 and 0.4 at the beginning of the experiment, depending on the size of the particles.

	abstract = {Ambient concentrations of many pollutants are associated with emissions due to human activity, such as road transport and other combustion sources. In this paper we consider air pollution as a multi--level phenomenon within a Bayesian hierarchical model. We examine different scales of variation in pollution concentrations ranging from large scale transboundary effects to more localised effects which are directly related to human activity. Specifically, in the first stage of the model, we isolate underlying patterns in pollution concentrations due to global factors such as underlying climate and topography, which are modelled together with spatial structure. At this stage measurements from monitoring sites located within rural areas are used which, as far as possible, are chosen to reflect background concentrations. Having isolated these global effects, in the second stage we assess the effects of human activity on pollution in urban areas. The proposed model was applied to concentrations of nitrogen dioxide measured throughout the EU for which significant increases are found to be associated with human activity in urban areas. The approach proposed here provides valuable information that could be used in performing health impact assessments and to inform policy.},

Since 2008, four emission measurement campaigns have been conducted at a Port of Los Angeles location and an inland weigh station in the South Coast Air Basin of California. Fuel specific oxides of nitrogen emissions at the Port have decreased 12\% since 2010 while infrared opacity (a measure of particulate matter) remained low, showing no diesel particulate filter deterioration. The weigh station truck?s fuel specific oxides of nitrogen emission reductions since 2010 (18.5\%) almost double the previous three year?s reductions and are the result of new trucks using selective catalytic reduction systems. Trucks at the weigh station equipped with these systems have a skewed oxides of nitrogen emissions distribution (half of the emissions were from 6\% of the measurements) and had significantly lower emissions than similarly equipped Port trucks. Infrared thermographs of truck exhaust pipes revealed that the mean temperature observed at the weigh station (225 ± 4.5 °C) was 70 °C higher than for Port trucks, suggesting that the catalytic aftertreatment systems on trucks at our Port site were often below minimum operating temperatures.},

Deposition in the tracheobronchial tree and acinar region was much smaller than that in the extrathoracic region. Variations in the deposition fractions due to differences in the size distributions were really significant only in the extrathoracic region. Surprisingly, the different size distributions yielded similar depositions in the thoracic region for a given gender as far as the shape of the deposition curve and the total amount are concerned. Regional deposition fractions were compared for the male, female and child, and for various size distributions (sampling location) and elements.},

	abstract = {Fine particles are highly related to human health, especially ultrafine particles and nanoparticles. The mass of emissions from a gasoline vehicle is relatively lower than that of a diesel vehicle, but the number of gasoline vehicles in China is so huge that the number of fine particles can't be ignored. An on-board measurement system was established to measure the instantaneous number and mass size distributions of fine particles emitted from a light-duty gasoline vehicle under a real-world driving condition. The exhaust gas was sampled from the inside of the tailpipe. Measurements were carried out using a light-duty gasoline vehicle for goods on a chassis dynamometer and on urban streets in a downtown area of Nanjing. Size and time resolved data were obtained from an Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS). The system was operated under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and steady-state speed tests. The comparisons of size distribution and number concentration (NC) in different driving cycles in the real-world with the results from the chassis dynamometer are shown. The time proportion of operating modes in NEDC is different from that on real urban roads. The particle sizes for the NCs obey a bimodal distribution from the on-road data with mode sizes of 10.8 nm and 39.2 nm, while those from the chassis dynamometer tests obey a unimodal distribution with a mode size of 10.8 nm. The maximum NCs of particles were increased as the vehicle operating modes changed from idling, cursing to deceleration and acceleration from the on-board measurements, while compared to that from the on-board measurements, the maximum concentrations at the mode size were however in different order and the cruising mode became the second highest peak instead of the deceleration mode. The ratios of the NCs from the chassis dynamometers to that from on-road data in the speed of 15 km h−1, 32 km h−1, and 50 km h−1 are 2.78, 2.19, and 0.48, respectively. Similarly for the mass concentration the ratios are 0.19, 0.17, and 0.009, respectively. The acceleration in the interval of 0.6–0.9 m s−2 has the greatest influence on the NC in on-road measurements, while the acceleration of 0.52 m s−2 has the most significant impact on the NC in the chassis dynamometer tests. The vehicle load increases the total number and mass concentration in a small range, showing no significant impact on particles size distribution especially the nanoparticles. The comparison shows that the fine particle emissions are indeed different between the NEDC and the on-road measurements in Nanjing. The differences show that the fine particles emission on the real road can't be represented well by the results in the NEDC, and the corresponding errors should be in consideration when the vehicle emissions from the NEDC are applied. The study makes us clear that the fine particles emission characteristics of the light-duty vehicle on the urban roads are really different with that in the NEDC.},

In this paper we investigate the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for air pollution monitoring in Mauritius. With the fast growing industrial activities on the island, the problem of air pollution is becoming a major concern for the health of the population. We proposed an innovative system named Wireless Sensor Network Air Pollution Monitoring System (WAPMS) to monitor air pollution in Mauritius through the use of wireless sensors deployed in huge numbers around the island. The proposed system makes use of an Air Quality Index (AQI) which is presently not available in Mauritius. In order to improve the efficiency of WAPMS, we have designed and implemented a new data aggregation algorithm named Recursive Converging Quartiles (RCQ). The algorithm is used to merge data to eliminate duplicates, filter out invalid readings and summarise them into a simpler form which significantly reduce the amount of data to be transmitted to the sink and thus saving energy. For better power management we used a hierarchical routing protocol in WAPMS and caused the motes to sleep during idle time.},

	abstract = {In response to growing public health concerns regarding elevated air pollutant exposures and adverse human health effects for near-road populations, a study was conducted to assess how complex urban roadway configurations affect local-scale air quality. This study combined fixed-site and mobile air quality measurements with laboratory wind tunnel experiments to examine how the transport and dispersion of traffic-emitted pollutants varies with changing roadway configuration, notably with at-grade and cut section designs. Results of the study indicated that short-term maximum concentrations occurred with measurements made along at-grade locations, however, average concentrations tended to be higher at the top of the cut section compared with the at-grade location, most often occurring during lower air pollutant events. Wind flow and NO2/NOx ratios indicated that the cut section moderated peak concentrations through increased transport and dispersion, as well as reducing the influence of turbulence from vehicle activity near the road. The at-grade locations also experienced a higher impact from primary vehicle emissions than those measurements made at similar distances along a cut section. Mobile monitoring suggested that these peak concentrations quickly conformed to concentration levels measured near cut sections within 50 to 100 meters of the source highway. Wind tunnel simulations of the study site with and without the cut section present indicated that the cut section reduced the concentrations of primary emitted vehicle pollutants by 15 to 25 percent for receptors located approximately 20 m from the highway. The wind tunnel simulations also revealed that buildings and other urban features influenced local-scale pollutant transport and need to be considered when evaluating near-road air quality.},

It was one of a series of planned steps toward reducing the negative environmental and health impacts of international shipping. This study investigates the effectiveness of the IMO regulation in reducing global sulfur emissions. We found a reduction in global average sulfur concentration of only 0.07\% points from 2011 to 2012. On the positive side, we also found that only 2.3\% of the bunkerings were noncompliant in 2012, that is, exceeded the new 3.50\% sulfur concentration cap. The analysis furthermore suggests that compliance with the new regulation is achieved by blending high sulfur fuel with lower sulfur fuel, rather than by removing high sulfur fuel from the market or removing the excess sulfur. The main conclusion is that the regulation has been effective in reducing the maximum sulfur concentration but has not been very effective in reducing the average sulfur concentration. Thus, the regulation may have resulted in local environmental benefits but has not resulted in global benefits with respect to global sulfur emissions from international shipping.},

	abstract = {We have derived ambient black carbon (BC) concentrations and estimated emission factors for on-road diesel vehicles from archived Coefficient of Haze (COH) data that was routinely collected beginning in 1967 at 11 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. COH values are a measure of the attenuation of light by particles collected on a white filter, and available data indicate they are proportional to BC concentrations measured using the conventional aethalometer. Monthly averaged BC concentrations are up to five times greater in winter than summer, and, consequently, so is the population?s exposure to BC. The seasonal cycle in BC concentrations is similar for all Bay Area sites, most likely due to area-wide decreased pollutant dispersion during wintertime. A strong weekly cycle is also evident, with weekend concentrations significantly lower than weekday concentrations, consistent with decreased diesel traffic volume on weekends. The weekly cycle suggests that, in the Bay Area, diesel vehicle emissions are the dominant source of BC aerosol. Despite the continuous increase in diesel fuel consumption in California, annual Bay Area average BC concentrations decreased by a factor of {\textasciitilde};;3 from the late 1960s to the early 2000s. Based on estimated annual BC concentrations, on-road diesel fuel consumption, and recent measurements of on-road diesel vehicle BC emissions, diesel BC emission factors decreased by an order of magnitude over the study period. Reductions in the BC emission factor reflect improved engine technology, emission controls and changes in diesel fuel composition. A new BC monitoring network is needed to continue tracking ambient BC trends because the network of COH monitors has recently been retired.},

Traffic exposure metrics include distance to high-traffic roads, traffic volume on nearby roads, traffic within buffer distances, measured pollutant concentrations, land-use regression estimates of pollution concentrations, and others. We used Geographic Information System software to explore a new approach using traffic count data and a kernel density calculation to generate a traffic density surface with a resolution of 50 m. The density value in each cell reflects all the traffic on all the roads within the distance specified in the kernel density algorithm. The effect of a given roadway on the raster cell value depends on the amount of traffic on the road segment, its distance from the raster cell, and the form of the algorithm. We used a Gaussian algorithm in which traffic influence became insignificant beyond 300 m. This metric integrates the deleterious effects of traffic rather than focusing on one pollutant. The density surface can be used to impute exposure at any point, and it can be used to quantify integrated exposure along a global positioning system route. The traffic density calculation compares favorably with other metrics for assessing traffic exposure and can be used in a variety of applications.},

We also observe that corridors with either a bicycle path or cycle track generally rank higher in terms of bicycle volume and also have higher NO2 concentrations than corridors without bicycle facilities.

	abstract = {A metric for the assessment of health effects of diesel exhaust particles is proposed and a methodology to determine it from experimental data is presented. The metric treats separately the emitted volatile and non-volatile mass fractions. The appropriate metric for health related effects of the non-volatile mass fraction (primarily soot), termed the physical effect, is taken to be the particle (active) surface area distribution. The corresponding metric of the volatile mass fraction (unburned hydrocarbons, sulfates, nitrates), termed the chemical effect, is taken to be the volatile mass concentration distribution of the nucleation mode and the mass concentration distribution of the condensed volatiles on the accumulation mode. The latter is proportional to distribution of the (active) surface area concentration of the accumulation mode. A methodology to derive the distributions (metric) from filter-based mass and number distributions measurements is suggested. Nine experimental particle number distribution, emitted by light duty Euro 1, 3 and 4 vehicles, with and without diesel particulate filters or catalysts, at different speeds and using different fuels, are analyzed to determine characteristic volatile mass and non-volatile surface area concentration distributions. These distributions become the required input distributions for lung deposition calculations, thereby defining the appropriate metric to estimate health effects of diesel exhaust particles.},

	abstract = {The steady growth in the number of vehicles on the road, heavy reliance on coal, use of dirty fuels for residential combustion, and extensive open burning are some of the major factors leading to the progressive deterioration of air quality in developing countries in Asia. And despite efforts to establish and implement air quality measurement systems, the development of infrastructure, environmental technology, and management practices continues to lag behind the rate of emission increase. Based on ten years of coordinated research, Integrated Air Quality Management: Asian Case Studiesdiscusses technical and policy tools for the integrated air quality management of developing countries in Asia.The book begins with an overview of major issues of air quality management practices in developing Asia and potential approaches to reduce pollution, including opportunities for integration of air quality improvement and climate migration strategies. It covers the methodology and results of fine particulate matter monitoring using traditional filter-based and satellite monitoring techniques. It examines the applications of a 3D dispersion modeling tool for urban and regional air quality management focusing on surface ozone, fine particulate matter, and acid deposition. The final chapters discuss innovative control technologies for gaseous air pollutants and illustrate the integrated air quality management in developing Asia through case studies for target source categories including agricultural residue field burning, vehicle emissions, brick kilns, and industrial VOC emission.Illustrated with case studies, this book presents an integrated air quality management methodology that employs technical and policy tools to achieve air quality goals. It includes technical information and policy recommendations based on the outcomes of several multi-year air quality research programs coordinated by the Asian Institute of Technology. The text combines fundamental information and advanced knowledge useful to large audiences dealing with subjects of integrated air quality management.},

Recent innovations in remote sensing technologies and data retrievals offer the potential for predicting UFP concentrations based on data from satellite-borne instrumentation. Herein we present a physically-based statistical algorithm to estimate UFP concentrations across eastern North America using remotely sensed Aerosol Optical Depth, Ångstrom exponent, ultraviolet solar radiation flux, and ammonia and sulfur dioxide concentrations. The proposed algorithm is built and independently evaluated using an array of in situ observations. The algorithm is able to capture up to 60\% of the variability in daily measured UFP number concentrations at a regionally representative reference site, and is thus applied to generate seasonal UFP concentration estimates across eastern North America. The resulting UFP concentrations are cross-evaluated with simulations from a global aerosol microphysics model. There is a negative bias in the model output relative to the satellite driven proxy, which is largest (up to 76\%) in summer, and may be due to over-estimation of UFP from the satellite-based algorithm derived herein, due to the higher availability of remote sensing data in clear-sky conditions or uncertainty in the model simulation of new particle formation. Nevertheless, the model and algorithm indicate similar spatial and seasonal variability (spatial correlation coefficients of 0.10 to 0.56), indicating the value of the satellite-based UFP proxy in global and regional model evaluation exercises and in efforts to identify regions where future in situ data collection should be prioritized.},

This study estimates the size and distribution of the population living near high volume roads in the US, investigates race and income disparities in these near roadway populations, and considers the coverage of the national ambient air quality monitoring network. Every US census block is classified by traffic density and proximity to roads falling within several traffic volume ranges using year 2008 traffic data and the 2010 and 2000 US Census. The results indicate that 19\% of the population lives near high volume roads. Nationally, greater traffic volume and density are associated with larger shares of non-white residents and lower median household incomes. Analysis at the county level finds wide variation in the size of near roadway populations and the severity of environmental justice concerns. Every state, however, has some population living near a high volume road and 84\% of counties show some level of disparity. The results also suggest that most counties with residents living near high volume roads do not have a co-located regulatory air quality monitor.},

	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a complex, heterogeneous mixture that changes in time and space. It encompasses many different chemical components and physical characteristics, many of which have been cited as potential contributors to toxicity. Each component has multiple sources, and each source generates multiple components. Identifying and quantifying the influences of specific components or source-related mixtures on measures of health-related impacts, especially when particles interact with other co-pollutants, therefore represents one of the most challenging areas of environmental health research. Current knowledge does not allow precise quantification or definitive ranking of the health effects of PM emissions from different sources or of individual PM components and indeed, associations may be the result of multiple components acting on different physiological mechanisms. Some results do suggest a degree of differential toxicity, namely more consistent associations with traffic-related PM emissions, fine and ultrafine particles, specific metals and elemental carbon and a range of serious health effects, including increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. A carefully targeted programme of contemporary toxicological and epidemiological research, incorporating more refined approaches (eg greater speciation data, more refined modelling techniques, accurate exposure assessment and better definition of individual susceptibility) and optimal collaboration amongst multidisciplinary teams, is now needed to advance our understanding of the relative toxicity of particles from various sources, especially the components and reactions products of traffic. This will facilitate targeted abatement policies, more effective pollution control measures and ultimately, a reduction in the burden of disease attributable to ambient PM pollution.},

However, individual-level air pollution exposure is difficult to measure at a high spatial and temporal resolution and for larger populations due to limitations in sampling techniques. We presented a hierarchical model to capture spatiotemporal variability of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations in Southern California by combining high temporal resolution data from routine monitoring stations with high spatial resolution data from investigator-initiated episodic measurements. In this model, the spatiotemporal field of concentrations was first decomposed into a mean and residual and the mean representing the seasonal trend was further decomposed into a constant and varying temporal basis functions. The mean of the spatially varying coefficients of temporal basis functions were modeled by local covariates using non-linear generalized additive model and least square fitting using measurements from both routine monitoring and additional episodic sampling locations, while the spatially-correlated residuals of the coefficients were co-kriged. We found traffic, land-use and wind accounted for a large portion of the variance (beyond 35\%) for the long-term average trend of concentrations. Spatial residuals accounted for a large portion of the variance of the temporal components (about 30\% for NO2 and 20\% for NOx). Leave-one-out cross validation produced an R2 of 0.84 for NO2 and 0.81 for NOx when comparing the modeled weekly concentration with the observed trends at all routine monitoring stations.},

However, low-cost air quality sensors not only drift over time but also suffer from cross-sensitivities and dependency on meteorological effects. Therefore calibration of measurements from low-cost sensors is indispensable to guarantee data accuracy and consistency to be fit for quantitative studies on air pollution. In this work we propose sensor array network calibration (SCAN), a multi-hop calibration technique for dependent low-cost sensors. SCAN is applicable to sets of co-located, heterogeneous sensors, known as sensor arrays, to compensate for cross-sensitivities and dependencies on meteorological influences. SCAN minimizes error accumulation over multiple hops of sensor arrays, which is unattainable with existing multi-hop calibration techniques. We formulate SCAN as a novel constrained least-squares regression and provide a closed-form expression of its regression parameters. We theoretically prove that SCAN is free from regression dilution even in presence of measurement noise. In-depth simulations demonstrate that SCAN outperforms various calibration techniques. Evaluations on two real-world low-cost air pollution sensor datasets comprising 66 million samples collected over three years show that SCAN yields 16\% to 60\% lower error than state-of-the-art calibration techniques.},

With increasing awareness of spatial variability in air pollution concentrations within cities and the importance of pollution gradients from traffic and neighborhood sources, such as residential wood combustion, there is an increasing need to also evaluate air pollution variability at local or neighborhood scales. While passive sampler networks, mobile monitoring campaigns and the application of land use regression and dispersion models have provided useful information on air pollution spatial variability, none of the approaches can fully characterize both short-term temporal and spatial gradients in pollutant concentrations. Recently, there has been a proliferation of low-cost, low power, miniaturized, autonomous (and typically wireless) air quality monitoring units that have the potential to be applied in dynamic dispersed high resolution air quality monitoring networks and to be used in "Citizen Science" applications. In this report we review new air quality monitoring technologies and discuss their use in the context of conventional monitoring and new applications.

	abstract = {Household air pollution generated from solid fuel use for cooking is one of the leading risk factors for ill-health globally. Deployment of advanced cookstoves to reduce emissions has been a major focus of intervention efforts. However, household usage of these stoves and resulting changes in usage of traditional polluting stoves is not well characterized. In Palwal District, Haryana, India, we carried out an intervention utilizing the Philips HD4012 fan-assisted stove, one of the cleanest biomass stoves available. We placed small, unobtrusive data-logging iButton thermometers on both the traditional and Philips stoves to collect continuous data on use patterns in 200 homes over 60 weeks. Intervention stove usage declined steadily over time and stabilized after approximately 200 days; use of the traditional stove remained relatively constant. We additionally evaluated how well short-duration usage measures predicted long-term use. Measuring usage over time of both traditional and intervention stoves provides better understanding of cooking behaviors and can lead to more precise quantification of potential exposure reductions and consequent health benefits attributable to interventions.},

	abstract = {Routine air monitoring provides data to assess urban scale temporal variation in pollution concentrations in relation to regulatory standards, but is not well suited to characterizing intraurban spatial variation in pollutant concentrations from local sources. To address these limitations and inform local control strategies, New York City developed a program to track spatial patterns of multiple air pollutants in each season of the year. Monitor locations include 150 distributed street-level sites chosen to represent a range of traffic, land-use and other characteristics. Integrated samples are collected at each distributed site for one 2-week session each season and in every 2-week period at five reference locations to track city-wide temporal variation. Pollutants sampled include PM2.5 and constituents, nitrogen oxides, black carbon, ozone (summer only) and sulfur dioxide (winter only). During the first full year of monitoring more than 95\% of designed samples were completed. Agreement between colocated samples was good (absolute mean \% difference 3.2–8.9\%). Street-level pollutant concentrations spanned a much greater range than did concentrations at regulatory monitors, especially for oxides of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide. Monitoring to characterize intraurban spatial gradients in ambient pollution usefully complements regulatory monitoring data to inform local air quality management.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies typically utilise one or few central monitoring stations as a proxy for personal exposure to particulate matter air pollution. However, recent research indicates that central monitoring sites may not accurately characterize the spatial complexities of the particulate field across an urban area. Consequently, intraurban assessment of exposure to air pollution has become a priority area of study. This paper reviews particulate air pollution exposure studies with a focus on monitored-data studies at the intraurban spatial scale. Portions of the literature provide contradictory conclusions as to the homogeneity of intraurban particulate concentrations, due in part to local conditions such as source composition, meteorology, locations of monitoring sites and topography, but which may also be a result of the methods and definitions used to quantify relative and absolute spatial concentration variations. Comparative analyses of the literature by particle size fraction, method of determining heterogeneity, and sampling characteristics were performed. We find that particular attention should be given to local conditions and methods when using one or few monitoring sites to characterise wider population exposures. The utilisation of absolute and relative measures of homogeneity such as the coefficient of divergence which are based on data from several monitoring sites (e.g., n \&gt; 4 ) in combination with an appropriate sample size (e.g., n ⩾ 50 ) may reduce the possibility of misclassification based on incorrect assumptions about heterogeneity. The errors in exposure misclassification based on these assumptions about intraurban concentration variations are especially critical in long-term cohort epidemiological analyses that assess the effects of exposure variations in air pollution upon health.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that on-road vehicle emissions are the dominant source of ultrafine particles (UFPs; diameter {\textless} 100 nm) in urban areas and near-roadway environments. In order to advance our knowledge on the complex interactions and competition among atmospheric dilution, dispersion, and dynamics of UFPs, an aerosol dynamics–computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled model is developed and validated against field measurements. A unique approach of applying periodic boundary conditions is proposed to model pollutant dispersion and dynamics in one unified domain from the tailpipe level to the ambient near-road environment. This approach significantly reduces the size of the computational domain, and therefore allows fast simulation of multiple scenarios. The model is validated against measured turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and horizontal gradient of pollution concentrations perpendicular to a major highway. Through a model sensitivity analysis, the relative importance of individual aerosol dynamical processes on the total particle number concentration (N) and particle number–size distribution (PSD) near a highway is investigated. The results demonstrate that (1) coagulation has a negligible effect on N and particle growth, (2) binary homogeneous nucleation (BHN) of H2SO4–H2O is likely responsible for elevated N closest to the road, and (3) N and particle growth are very sensitive to the condensation of semi-volatile organics (SVOCs), particle dry deposition, and the interaction between these processes. The results also indicate that, without the proper treatment of the atmospheric boundary layer (i.e., its wind profile and turbulence quantities), the nucleation rate would be underestimated by a factor of 5 in the vehicle wake region due to overestimated dilution. Therefore, introducing atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions to activity-based emission models may potentially improve their performance in estimating UFP traffic emissions.},

The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate. This article illustrates the drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities, while addressing the major challenges for their effective implementation.},

Recent studies reveal the importance of micro-level pollution information, including human personal exposure and acute exposure to air pollutants. A real-time system with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential because of the limited data availability and non-scalability of conventional air pollution monitoring systems. Currently, researchers focus on the concept of The Next Generation Air Pollution Monitoring System (TNGAPMS) and have achieved significant breakthroughs by utilizing the advance sensing technologies, MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). However, there exist potential problems of these newly proposed systems, namely the lack of 3D data acquisition ability and the flexibility of the sensor network. In this paper, we classify the existing works into three categories as Static Sensor Network (SSN), Community Sensor Network (CSN) and Vehicle Sensor Network (VSN) based on the carriers of the sensors. Comprehensive reviews and comparisons among these three types of sensor networks were also performed. Last but not least, we discuss the limitations of the existing works and conclude the objectives that we want to achieve in future systems.},

	abstract = {Advances in air pollution sensor technology have enabled the development of small and low-cost systems to measure outdoor air pollution. The deployment of a large number of sensors across a small geographic area would have potential benefits to supplement traditional monitoring networks with additional geographic and temporal measurement resolution, if the data quality were sufficient. To understand the capability of emerging air sensor technology, the Community Air Sensor Network (CAIRSENSE) project deployed low-cost, continuous, and commercially available air pollution sensors at a regulatory air monitoring site and as a local sensor network over a surrounding  ∼ 2 km area in the southeastern United States. Collocation of sensors measuring oxides of nitrogen, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particles revealed highly variable performance, both in terms of comparison to a reference monitor as well as the degree to which multiple identical sensors produced the same signal. Multiple ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide sensors revealed low to very high correlation with a reference monitor, with Pearson sample correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.39 to 0.97, −0.25 to 0.76, and −0.40 to 0.82, respectively. The only sulfur dioxide sensor tested revealed no correlation (r {\textless} 0.5) with a reference monitor and erroneously high concentration values. A wide variety of particulate matter (PM) sensors were tested with variable results – some sensors had very high agreement (e.g., r =  0.99) between identical sensors but moderate agreement with a reference PM2.5 monitor (e.g., r =  0.65). For select sensors that had moderate to strong correlation with reference monitors (r {\textgreater} 0.5), step-wise multiple linear regression was performed to determine if ambient temperature, relative humidity (RH), or age of the sensor in number of sampling days could be used in a correction algorithm to improve the agreement. Maximum improvement in agreement with a reference, incorporating all factors, was observed for an NO2 sensor (multiple correlation coefficient R2adj-orig = 0.57, R2adj-final = 0.81); however, other sensors showed no apparent improvement in agreement. A four-node sensor network was successfully able to capture ozone (two nodes) and PM (four nodes) data for an 8-month period of time and show expected diurnal concentration patterns, as well as potential ozone titration due to nearby traffic emissions. Overall, this study demonstrates the performance of emerging air quality sensor technologies in a real-world setting; the variable agreement between sensors and reference monitors indicates that in situ testing of sensors against benchmark monitors should be a critical aspect of all field studies.},

Unfortunately, a great deal of effort is wasted by repeating the same research by several private companies/public institutes or within several European projects. Moreover, when a technological solution is found, it is generally subjected to confidentiality aspects of the intellectual property right. In order to facilitate the use of sensors by diminishing the operational and development costs, the Joint Research Centre is developing a multi-sensor platform, called AirSensEUR, for the monitoring of air pollution at low concentration levels. All development aspects owned by JRC about AirSensEUR is made available to all stockholders though the use of public licenses. AirSensEUR is developed as an open software/open hardware object that has the capacity to behave as a node within a network of multi sensors assuring interoperability and compliance with the INSPIRE Directive.},

	abstract = {Budapest platform for Aerosol Research and Training (BpART) was created for advancing long-term on-line atmospheric measurements and intensive aerosol sample collection campaigns in Budapest. A joint study including atmospheric chemistry or physics, meteorology, and fluid dynamics on several-year-long data sets obtained at the platform confirmed that the location represents a well-mixed, average atmospheric environment for the city centre. The air streamlines indicated that the host and neighbouring buildings together with the natural orography play an important role in the near-field dispersion processes. Details and features of the airflow structure were derived, and they can be readily utilised for further interpretations. An experimental method to determine particle diffusion losses in the differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) system of the BpART facility was proposed. It is based on CPC–CPC (condensation particle counter) and DMPS–CPC comparisons. Growth types of nucleated particles observed in 4 years of measurements were presented and discussed specifically for cities. Arch-shaped size distribution surface plots consisting of a growth phase followed by a shrinkage phase were characterised separately since they supply information on nucleated particles. They were observed in 4.5 \% of quantifiable nucleation events. The shrinkage phase took 1 h 34 min in general, and the mean shrinkage rate with standard deviation was −3.8 ± 1.0 nm h−1. The shrinkage of particles was mostly linked to changes in local atmospheric conditions, especially in global radiation and the gas-phase H2SO4 concentration through its proxy, or to atmospheric mixing in few cases. Some indirect results indicate that variations in the formation and growth rates of nucleated particles during their atmospheric transport could be a driving force of shrinkage for particles of very small sizes and on specific occasions.},

Passive samplers were deployed for week-long intervals in triplicate and colocated with a federal reference method sampler at three sites and for 5 weeks in summer 2009 and 5 weeks in winter 2010 in Cleveland, OH. The limit of detection of the passive method for PM10–2.5 determined from blank analysis was 2.8 μg m–3. Overall precision expressed as root-mean-square coefficient of variation (CVRMS) improved with increasing concentrations (37\% for all samples, n = 30; 19\% for PM10–2.5 {\textgreater} 10 μg m–3, n = 9; and 10\% for PM10–2.5 {\textgreater} 15 μg m–3, n = 4). The linear regression of PM10–2.5 measured passively on that measured with the reference sampler exhibited an intercept not statistically different than zero (p = 0.46) and a slope not statistically different from unity (p = 0.92). Triplicates with high CVs (CV {\textgreater} 40\%, n = 5) were attributed to low particle counts (and mass concentrations), spurious counts attributed to salt particles, and Al-rich particles. This work provides important quantitative observations that can help guide future development and use of passive samplers for measuring atmospheric particulate matter.},

While PM2.5 is relatively well studied, less is known about the sources and fate of PM10−2.5. The Colorado Coarse Rural-Urban Sources and Health (CCRUSH) study measured PM10−2.5 and PM2.5 mass concentrations, as well as the fraction of semi-volatile material (SVM) in each size regime (SVM2.5, SVM10−2.5), from 2009 to early 2012 in Denver and comparatively rural Greeley, Colorado. Agricultural operations east of Greeley appear to have contributed to the peak PM10−2.5 concentrations there, but concentrations were generally lower in Greeley than in Denver. Traffic-influenced sites in Denver had PM10−2.5 concentrations that averaged from 14.6 to 19.7 µg m−3 and mean PM10−2.5 ∕ PM10 ratios of 0.56 to 0.70, higher than at residential sites in Denver or Greeley. PM10−2.5 concentrations were more temporally variable than PM2.5 concentrations. Concentrations of the two pollutants were not correlated. Spatial correlations of daily averaged PM10−2.5 concentrations ranged from 0.59 to 0.62 for pairs of sites in Denver and from 0.47 to 0.70 between Denver and Greeley. Compared to PM10−2.5, concentrations of PM2.5 were more correlated across sites within Denver and less correlated between Denver and Greeley. PM10−2.5 concentrations were highest during the summer and early fall, while PM2.5 and SVM2.5 concentrations peaked in winter during periodic multi-day inversions. SVM10−2.5 concentrations were low at all sites. Diurnal peaks in PM10−2.5 and PM2.5 concentrations corresponded to morning and afternoon peaks of traffic activity, and were enhanced by boundary layer dynamics. SVM2.5 concentrations peaked around noon on both weekdays and weekends. PM10−2.5 concentrations at sites located near highways generally increased with wind speeds above about 3 m s−1. Little wind speed dependence was observed for the residential sites in Denver and Greeley. The mass concentration data reported here are being used in ongoing epidemiologic studies for PM in northeastern Colorado.},

	abstract = {Indoor ultrafine particles (UFP, {\textless}100 nm) released from combustion and consumer products lead to elevated human exposure to UFP. UFP emitted from the sources undergo aerosol transformation processes such as coagulation and deposition. The coagulation effect can be significant during the source emission due to high concentration and high mobility of nanosize particles. However, few studies have estimated size-resolved UFP source emission strengths while considering coagulation in their theoretical and experimental research work. The primary objective of this study is to characterize UFP source strength by considering coagulation in addition to other indoor processes (i.e., deposition and ventilation) in a realistic setting. A secondary objective is to test a hypothesis that size-resolved UFP source emission rates are unimodal and log–normally distributed for three common indoor UFP sources: an electric stove, a natural gas burner, and a paraffin wax candle. Experimental investigations were performed in a full-scale test building. Size- and time-resolved concentrations of UFP ranging from 2 to 100 nm were monitored using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). Based on the temporal evolution of the particle size distribution during the source emission period, the size-dependent source emission rate was determined using a material-balance modeling approach. The results indicate that, for a given UFP source, the source strength varies with particle size and source type. The analytical model assuming a log–normally distributed source emission rate could predict the temporal evolution of the particle size distribution with reasonable accuracy for the gas stove and the candle. Including the effect of coagulation was found to increase the estimates of source strengths by up to a factor of 8. This result implies that previous studies on indoor UFP source strengths considering only deposition and ventilation might have largely underestimated the true values of UFP source strengths, especially for combustion due to the natural gas stove and the candle.},

	abstract = {Extremely severe haze weather events occurred in many cities in China, especially in the east part of the country, in January 2013. Comprehensive measurements including hourly concentrations of PM2.5 and its major chemical components (water-soluble inorganic ions, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC)) and related gas-phase precursors were conducted via an online monitoring system in Suzhou, a medium-sized city in Jiangsu province, just east of Shanghai. PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 µm or less) frequently exceeded 150 µg m−3 on hazy days, with the maximum reaching 324 µg m−3 on 14 January 2013. Unfavorable weather conditions (high relative humidity (RH), and low rainfall, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure) were conducive to haze formation. High concentrations of secondary aerosol species (including SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, and SOC) and gaseous precursors were observed during the first two haze events, while elevated primary carbonaceous species emissions were found during the third haze period, pointing to different haze formation mechanisms. Organic matter (OM), (NH4)2SO4, and NH4NO3 were found to be the major contributors to visibility impairment. High concentrations of sulfate and nitrate might be explained by homogeneous gas-phase reactions under low RH conditions and by heterogeneous processes under relatively high RH conditions. Analysis of air mass trajectory clustering and potential source contribution function showed that aerosol pollution in the studied areas was mainly caused by local activities and surrounding sources transported from nearby cities.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the optical properties (absorption, scattering and extinction) of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 made at two sites around Sacramento, CA, during the June 2010 Carbonaceous Aerosols and Radiative Effects Study (CARES) are reported. These observations are used to establish relationships between various intensive optical properties and to derive information about the dependence of the optical properties on photochemical aging and sources. Supermicron particles contributed substantially to the total light scattering at both sites, about 50 \% on average. A strong, linear relationship is observed between the scattering Ångström exponent for PM10 and the fraction of the scattering that is contributed by submicron particles (fsca, PM1) at both sites and with similar slopes and intercepts (for a given pair of wavelengths), suggesting that the derived relationship may be generally applicable for understanding variations in particle size distributions from remote sensing measurements. At the more urban T0 site, the fsca, PM1 increased with photochemical age, whereas at the downwind, more rural T1 site the fsca, PM1 decreased slightly with photochemical age. This difference in behavior reflects differences in transport, local production and local emission of supermicron particles between the sites. Light absorption is dominated by submicron particles, but there is some absorption by supermicron particles ( ∼  15 \% of the total). The supermicron absorption derives from a combination of black carbon that has penetrated into the supermicron mode and from dust, and there is a clear increase in the mass absorption coefficient of just the supermicron particles with increasing average particle size. The mass scattering coefficient (MSC) for the supermicron particles was directly observed to vary inversely with the average particle size, demonstrating that MSC cannot always be treated as a constant in estimating mass concentrations from scattering measurements, or vice versa. The total particle backscatter fraction exhibited some dependence upon the relative abundance of sub- versus supermicron particles; however this was modulated by variations in the median size of particles within a given size range; variations in the submicron size distribution had a particularly large influence on the observed backscatter efficiency and an approximate method to account for this variability is introduced. The relationship between the absorption and scattering Ångström exponents is examined and used to update a previously suggested particle classification scheme. Differences in composition led to differences in the sensitivity of PM2.5 to heating in a thermodenuder to the average particle size, with more extensive evaporation (observed as a larger decrease in the PM2.5 extinction coefficient) corresponding to smaller particles; i.e., submicron particles were generally more susceptible to heating than the supermicron particles. The influence of heating on the particle hygroscopicity varied with the effective particle size, with larger changes observed when the PM2.5 distribution was dominated by smaller particles.},

Future policy actions will benefit from improved understanding of the interactions and health effects of different chemical species and source categories.

In particular, research is needed to better understand the chemical and physical properties of complex air pollutant mixtures, and to use new observations provided by satellites, advanced in situ measurement techniques, and distributed micro monitoring networks, coupled with models, to better characterize air pollution exposure for epidemiological and toxicological research, and to better quantify the effects of specific source sectors and mitigation strategies.},

Results show that the health and economic impacts may be substantial in provinces with a high PM2.5 concentration. In the WoPol scenario without PM2.5 pollution control policy, we estimate that China experiences a 2.00\% GDP loss and 25.2 billion USD in health expenditure from PM2.5 pollution in 2030. In contrast, with control policy in the WPol scenario, a control investment of 101.8 billion USD (0.79\% of GDP) and a gain of 1.17\% of China?s GDP from improving PM2.5 pollution are projected. At the provincial level, GDP loss in 2030 in the WoPol scenario is high in Tianjin (3.08\%), Shanghai (2.98\%), Henan (2.32\%), Beijing (2.75\%), and Hebei (2.60\%) and the top five provinces with the highest additional health expenditure are Henan, Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu. Controlling PM2.5 pollution could bring positive benefits in two-thirds of provinces. Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, Henan, Jiangsu, and Hebei experience most benefits from PM2.5 pollution control as a result of a higher PM2.5 pollution and dense population distribution. Conversely, the control investment is higher than GDP gain in some underdeveloped provinces, such as Ningxia, Guizhou, Shanxi, Gansu, and Yunnan.},

Our objective is to establish a hybrid model which incorporates multiple approaches and input variables to improve model performance. To account for complex atmospheric mechanisms, we used a neural network for its capacity to model nonlinearity and interactions. We used convolutional layers, which aggregate neighboring information, into a neural network to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation. We trained the neural network for the continental United States from 2000 to 2012 and tested it with left out monitors. Ten-fold cross-validation revealed a good model performance with a total R2 of 0.84 on the left out monitors. Regional R2 could be even higher for the Eastern and Central United States. Model performance was still good at low PM2.5 concentrations. Then, we used the trained neural network to make daily predictions of PM2.5 at 1 km ? 1 km grid cells. This model allows epidemiologists to access PM2.5 exposure in both the short-term and the long-term.},

Comprehension of diagrams was enhanced by asking students questions that required them to predict the behavior of the machine from static diagrams and by providing them with a verbal description of the dynamic processes. This article proposes that predicting motion from static diagrams engages students' mental animation processes, including spatial visualization, and provides them with information about what they do and do not understand about how the machine works. Verbal instruction provides information that is not easily communicated in graphics and directs students' attention to the relevant information in static and animated diagrams. The research suggests that an understanding of students' mental animation abilities is an important component of a theory of learning from external animations.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the classification and visualisation utility of the self-organising map (SOM) method in the context of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, using gridded NCEP/NCAR geopotential height reanalysis for east Australia, together with multi-site meteorological and air quality data for Sydney from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage Air Quality Monitoring Network. A twice-daily synoptic classification has been derived for east Australia for the period of 1958–2012. The classification has not only reproduced the typical synoptic patterns previously identified in the literature but also provided an opportunity to visualise the subtle, non-linear change in the eastward-migrating synoptic systems influencing NSW (including Sydney). The summarisation of long-term, multi-site air quality/meteorological data from the Sydney basin on the SOM plane has identified a set of typical air pollution/meteorological spatial patterns in the region. Importantly, the examination of these patterns in relation to synoptic weather types has provided important visual insights into how local and synoptic meteorological conditions interact with each other and affect the variability of air quality in tandem. The study illustrates that while synoptic circulation types are influential, the within-type variability in mesoscale flows plays a critical role in determining local ozone levels in Sydney. These results indicate that the SOM can be a useful tool for assessing the impact of weather and climatic conditions on air quality in the regional airshed. This study further promotes the use of the SOM method in environmental research.},

Short-term measurements are required to characterize the highly variable and rapidly changing UFP concentration generated by vehicles. Under congestion conditions, the UFP vehicle EFs increased from 0.5 ? 1013 to 2 ? 1013 (particles km?1 vehicle?1) when vehicle flow increased from 5500 to 7500 vehicles/h. For free-flow conditions, the EF is constant at 1.5 ? 1013 (particles km?1 vehicle?1). The analysis is based on the assumption that air-quality models adequately describe the dilution process due to both traffic and atmospheric turbulence. The approach used to verify this assumption was to use an emission factor model to determine EFs for CO and then estimate dilution factors using measured CO concentrations. This procedure eliminates the need to rely only on air quality models to generate dilution factors. The EFs are suitable for fleet emissions under real-world traffic conditions.},

An air quality prediction system is developed to predict such events in near–real-time up to three days in advance for nine cities with regular air quality monitoring: Santiago, Rancagua, Curicó, Talca, Chillan, Los Ángeles, Temuco, Valdivia and Osorno. The system uses the WRF-Chem model configured with a nested 2 km grid-spacing domain to predict weather and inert tracers. The tracers are converted to hourly PM2.5 concentrations using an observationally based calibration which is substantially less computationally intensive than a full chemistry model. The conversion takes into account processes occurring in these cities, including higher likelihood of episode occurrence during weekends and during colder days, the latter related to increased wood-burning-stove activity for heating. The system is calibrated and evaluated for April-August 2014 where it has an overall skill of 53-72\% of episodes accurately forecasted (61-76\% for the best initialization) which is better than persistence for most stations. Forecasts one, two and three days in advance all have skill in forecasting events but often present large variability within them due to different meteorological initializations. The system is being implemented in Chile to assist authority decisions not only to warn the population but also to take contingency-based emission restrictions to try to avoid severe pollution events.},

	abstract = {We developed a model (CiTTy-Street-UFP) of traffic-related particle behaviour in a street canyon and in the nearby downwind urban background that accounts for aerosol dynamics and the variable vapour pressure of component organics. The model simulates the evolution and fate of traffic generated multicomponent ultrafine particles (UFP) composed of a non-volatile core and 17 Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOC, modelled as n-alkane proxies). A two-stage modelling approach is adopted: (1) a steady state simulation inside the street canyon is achieved, in which there exists a balance between traffic emissions, condensation/evaporation, deposition, coagulation and exchange with the air above roof-level; and (2) a continuing simulation of the above-roof air parcel advected to the nearby urban park during which evaporation is dominant. We evaluate the component evaporation and associated composition changes of multicomponent organic particles in realistic atmospheric conditions and compare our results with observations from London (UK) in a street canyon and an urban park. With plausible input conditions and parameter settings, the model can reproduce, with reasonable fidelity, size distributions in central London in 2007. The modelled nucleation-mode peak diameter, which is 23 nm in the steady-state street canyon, decreases to 9 nm in a travel time of just 120 s. All modelled SVOC in the sub-10 nm particle size range have evaporated leaving behind only non-volatile material, whereas modelled particle composition in the Aitken mode contains SVOC between C26H54 and C32H66. No data on particle composition are available in the study used for validation, or elsewhere. Measurements addressing in detail the size resolved composition of the traffic emitted UFP in the atmosphere are a high priority for future research. Such data would improve the representation of these particles in dispersion models and provide the data essential for model validation. Enhanced knowledge of the chemical composition of nucleation-mode particles from diesel engine exhaust is needed to predict both their atmospheric behaviour and their implications for human health.},

	abstract = {Background
Changes in climate systems are increasing heat wave frequency and air stagnation, both conditions associated with exacerbating poor air quality and of considerable public health concern.
Objectives
Heat and air pollution advisory systems are in place in many cities for early detection and response to reduce health consequences, or severity of adverse conditions. Whereas the ability to forecast heat waves and/or air pollution episodes has become increasingly sophisticated and accurate, little is known about the effectiveness of advisories in altering public behavior.
Methods
Air quality and meteorological conditions were measured during advisory and control days in Portland, OR and Houston, TX in 2005 and 2006 and 1962 subjects were interviewed by telephone about their perception and response to these conditions.
Results
Elevated ambient temperatures were accurately recognized regardless of air conditioning use; in Portland, respondents resorted to active cooling behavior (AC, fan, etc.), while in Houston no such change was observed. More heat-related symptoms were reported in Portland compared to Houston, probably due to low air conditioning use in the northwest. One-third of study participants were aware of air quality advisories but only ∼10–15\% claimed to have changed activities during such an episode. Not the advisory, however, drove their behavior change, but rather the perception of poor air quality, which was not related to PM2.5 or ozone measurements.
Conclusions
Messages are not reaching the public during potentially hazardous weather and air quality conditions. Climatic forecasts are increasingly predictive but public agencies fail to mount an appropriate outreach response.},

Putting this into numbers, in 1990 fewer than 4 in 10 people lived in urban areas. In 2010, more than half live in cities, and by 2050 this proportion will grow to 7 out of every 10 people. The number of urban residents is growing by nearly 60 million every year. This demographic transition from rural to urban, or urbanization, has far-reaching consequences. Urbanization has been associated with overall shifts in the economy, away from agriculture-based activities and towards mass industry, technology and service.

	abstract = {Understanding and quantifying outdoor and indoor sources of human exposure are essential but often not adequately addressed in health effect studies for air pollution. Air pollution epidemiology, risk assessment, health tracking, and accountability assessments are examples of health effect studies that require but often lack adequate exposure information. Recent advances in exposure modeling along with better information on time–activity and exposure factor data provide us with unique opportunities to improve the assignment of exposures for both future and ongoing studies linking air pollution to health impacts. In September 2006, scientists from the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with scientists from the academic community and state health departments convened a symposium on air pollution exposure and health to identify, evaluate, and improve current approaches for linking air pollution exposures to disease. This manuscript presents the key issues, challenges, and recommendations identified by the exposure working group, who used case studies of particulate matter, ozone, and toxic air-pollutant exposure to evaluate health effects for air pollution. One of the overarching lessons of this workshop is that obtaining better exposure information for these different health effect studies requires both goal setting for what is needed and mapping out the transition pathway from current capabilities for meeting these goals. Meeting our long-term goals requires definition of incremental steps that provide useful information for the interim and move us toward our long-term goals. Another overarching theme among the three different pollutants and the different health study approaches is the need for integration among alternate exposure-assessment approaches. For example, different groups may advocate exposure indicators, biomonitoring, mapping methods (GIS), modeling, environmental media monitoring, and/or personal exposure modeling. However, emerging research reveals that the greatest progress comes from integration among two or more of these efforts.},

Thirty-one percent of the PM3 emissions from diesel vehicles were black carbon and 0.86\% particle bound PAR Due to the high fraction emitted by diesel engines the contribution of gasoline engines could not be evaluated by the statistical model.

The volatile organic compound (VOC) data at nine photochemical pollutant monitoring stations available since 2007 were utilized in order to examine their effect on the ozone chemistry. The land-use types, set by the Korean government, were generally consistent with the satellite-derived land covers and with the previous result showing anti-correlation between O3 and NO2 in diverse urban areas. The relationship between the two pollutants in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) residence land-use areas was substantially different from that outside of the SMA, probably due to the local differences in vehicle emissions. The highest concentrations of air pollutants in the diurnal, weekly, and annual cycles were found in industry for SO2 and PMPM10, in commerce for NO2 and CO, and in greenbelt for O3. The concentrations of air pollutants, except for O3, were generally higher in big cities during weekdays, while O3 showed its peak in suburban areas or small cities during weekends. The weekly cycle and trends of O3 were significantly out of phase with those of NO2, particularly in the residential and commercial areas, suggesting that vehicle emission was a major source in those areas. The ratios of VOCs to NO2 for each of the land-use types were in the order of I (10.2) {\textgreater} C (8.7) {\textgreater} G (3.9) {\textgreater} R (3.6), suggesting that most areas in South Korea were likely to be VOC-limited for ozone chemistry. The pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and PMPM10 except for O3 have decreased, most likely due to the effective government control. The total oxidant values (OX = O3 + NO2) with the land-use types were analyzed for the local and regional (or background) contributions of O3, respectively, and the order of OX (ppb) was C (57.4) {\textgreater} R (53.6) {\textgreater} I (50.7) {\textgreater} G (45.4), indicating the greenbelt observation was close to the background.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a summary of the work done within the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ECLIPSE (Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants). ECLIPSE had a unique systematic concept for designing a realistic and effective mitigation scenario for short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs; methane, aerosols and ozone, and their precursor species) and quantifying its climate and air quality impacts, and this paper presents the results in the context of this overarching strategy. The first step in ECLIPSE was to create a new emission inventory based on current legislation (CLE) for the recent past and until 2050. Substantial progress compared to previous work was made by including previously unaccounted types of sources such as flaring of gas associated with oil production, and wick lamps. These emission data were used for present-day reference simulations with four advanced Earth system models (ESMs) and six chemistry transport models (CTMs). The model simulations were compared with a variety of ground-based and satellite observational data sets from Asia, Europe and the Arctic. It was found that the models still underestimate the measured seasonality of aerosols in the Arctic but to a lesser extent than in previous studies. Problems likely related to the emissions were identified for northern Russia and India, in particular. To estimate the climate impacts of SLCPs, ECLIPSE followed two paths of research: the first path calculated radiative forcing (RF) values for a large matrix of SLCP species emissions, for different seasons and regions independently. Based on these RF calculations, the Global Temperature change Potential metric for a time horizon of 20 years (GTP20) was calculated for each SLCP emission type. This climate metric was then used in an integrated assessment model to identify all emission mitigation measures with a beneficial air quality and short-term (20-year) climate impact. These measures together defined a SLCP mitigation (MIT) scenario. Compared to CLE, the MIT scenario would reduce global methane (CH4) and black carbon (BC) emissions by about 50 and 80 \%, respectively. For CH4, measures on shale gas production, waste management and coal mines were most important. For non-CH4 SLCPs, elimination of high-emitting vehicles and wick lamps, as well as reducing emissions from gas flaring, coal and biomass stoves, agricultural waste, solvents and diesel engines were most important. These measures lead to large reductions in calculated surface concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. We estimate that in the EU, the loss of statistical life expectancy due to air pollution was 7.5 months in 2010, which will be reduced to 5.2 months by 2030 in the CLE scenario. The MIT scenario would reduce this value by another 0.9   to 4.3 months. Substantially larger reductions due to the mitigation are found for China (1.8 months) and India (11–12 months). The climate metrics cannot fully quantify the climate response. Therefore, a second research path was taken. Transient climate ensemble simulations with the four ESMs were run for the CLE and MIT scenarios, to determine the climate impacts of the mitigation. In these simulations, the CLE scenario resulted in a surface temperature increase of 0.70 ± 0.14 K between the years 2006 and 2050. For the decade 2041–2050, the warming was reduced by 0.22 ± 0.07 K in the MIT scenario, and this result was in almost exact agreement with the response calculated based on the emission metrics (reduced warming of 0.22 ± 0.09 K). The metrics calculations suggest that non-CH4 SLCPs contribute {\textasciitilde} 22 \% to this response and CH4 78 \%. This could not be fully confirmed by the transient simulations, which attributed about 90 \% of the temperature response to CH4 reductions. Attribution of the observed temperature response to non-CH4 SLCP emission reductions and BC specifically is hampered in the transient simulations by small forcing and co-emitted species of the emission basket chosen. Nevertheless, an important conclusion is that our mitigation basket as a whole would lead to clear benefits for both air quality and climate. The climate response from BC reductions in our study is smaller than reported previously, possibly because our study is one of the first to use fully coupled climate models, where unforced variability and sea ice responses cause relatively strong temperature fluctuations that may counteract (and, thus, mask) the impacts of small emission reductions. The temperature responses to the mitigation were generally stronger over the continents than over the oceans, and with a warming reduction of 0.44 K (0.39–0.49) K the largest over the Arctic. Our calculations suggest particularly beneficial climate responses in southern Europe, where surface warming was reduced by about 0.3 K and precipitation rates were increased by about 15 (6–21) mm yr−1 (more than 4 \% of total precipitation) from spring to autumn. Thus, the mitigation could help to alleviate expected future drought and water shortages in the Mediterranean area. We also report other important results of the ECLIPSE project.},

	abstract = {A high concentration of volatile nucleation mode particles (NUP) formed in the atmosphere when the exhaust cools and dilutes has hazardous health effects and it impairs the visibility in urban areas. Nucleation mechanisms in diesel exhaust are only poorly understood. We performed model studies using two sectional aerosol dynamics process models AEROFOR and MAFOR on the formation of particles in the exhaust of a diesel engine, equipped with an oxidative after-treatment system and running with low fuel sulfur content (FSC) fuel, under laboratory sampling conditions where the dilution system mimics real-world conditions. Different nucleation mechanisms were tested. Based on the measured gaseous sulfuric acid (GSA) and non-volatile core and soot particle number concentrations of the raw exhaust, the model simulations showed that the best agreement between model predictions and measurements in terms of particle number size distribution was obtained by barrier-free heteromolecular homogeneous nucleation between the GSA and a semi-volatile organic vapour combined with the homogeneous nucleation of GSA alone. Major growth of the particles was predicted to occur due to the similar organic vapour at concentrations of (1−2)  × 1012 cm−3. The pre-existing core and soot mode concentrations had an opposite trend on the NUP formation, and the maximum NUP formation was predicted if a diesel particle filter (DPF) was used. On the other hand, the model predicted that the NUP formation ceased if the GSA concentration in the raw exhaust was less than 1010 cm−3, which was the case when biofuel was used.},

The campaigns were part of the Megacities: Emissions, urban, regional and Global Atmospheric POLlution and climate effects, and Integrated tools for assessment and mitigation (MEGAPOLI) project. New particle formation (NPF) was observed only during summer on approximately 50 \% of the campaign days, assisted by the low condensation sink (about 10.7 ± 5.9 × 10−3 s−1). NPF events inside the Paris plume were also observed at 600 m altitude onboard an aircraft simultaneously with regional events identified on the ground. Increased particle number concentrations were measured aloft also outside of the Paris plume at the same altitude, and were attributed to NPF. The Paris plume was identified, based on increased particle number and black carbon concentration, up to 200 km away from the Paris center during summer. The number concentration of particles with diameters exceeding 2.5 nm measured on the surface at the Paris center was on average 6.9 ± 8.7 × 104 and 12.1 ± 8.6 × 104 cm−3 during summer and winter, respectively, and was found to decrease exponentially with distance from Paris. However, further than 30 km from the city center, the particle number concentration at the surface was similar during both campaigns. During summer, one suburban site in the NE was not significantly affected by Paris emissions due to higher background number concentrations, while the particle number concentration at the second suburban site in the SW increased by a factor of 3 when it was downwind of Paris.},

	abstract = {Hydrocarbons are key precursors to two priority air pollutants, ozone and particulate matter. Those with two to seven carbons have historically been straightforward to observe and have been successfully reduced in many developed cities through air quality policy interventions. Longer chain hydrocarbons released from diesel vehicles are not considered explicitly as part of air quality strategies and there are few direct measurements of their gaseous abundance in the atmosphere. This study describes the chemically comprehensive and continuous measurements of organic compounds in a developed megacity (London), which demonstrate that on a seasonal median basis, diesel-related hydrocarbons represent only 20–30 \% of the total hydrocarbon mixing ratio but comprise more than 50 \%  of the atmospheric hydrocarbon mass and are a dominant local source of secondary organic aerosols. This study shows for the first time that 60 \%  of the winter primary hydrocarbon hydroxyl radical reactivity is from diesel-related hydrocarbons and using the maximum incremental reactivity scale, we predict that they contribute up to 50 \%  of the ozone production potential in London. Comparing real-world urban composition with regulatory emissions inventories in the UK and US highlights a previously unaccounted for, but very significant, under-reporting of diesel-related hydrocarbons; an underestimation of a factor {\textasciitilde}4 for C9 species rising to a factor of over 70 for C12 during winter. These observations show that hydrocarbons from diesel vehicles can dominate gas phase reactive carbon in cities with high diesel fleet fractions. Future control of urban particulate matter and ozone in such locations requires a shift in policy focus onto gas phase hydrocarbons released from diesels as this vehicle type continues to displace gasoline world-wide.},

Data sets of such urban parameters as land use, building morphology and street geometry in high-resolution grid cells in combination with direct measurements of airborne pollutants at high frequency (1–10 s) along a reasonable number of streets can be used to interpolate concentration of pollutants in a whole gridded domain and determine the optimum number of monitoring sites and best locations for a network of fixed monitors at ground level. In this context, a data-driven modeling methodology is developed based on the application of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to approximate the nonlinear relations between urban parameters (80 in this work) and aerosol pollution data, such as mass and number concentrations measured along streets of a commercial/residential neighborhood of Singapore. Cross-validations between measured and predicted aerosol concentrations based on the urban parameters at each individual grid cell showed satisfying results. This proof of concept study showed that the selected urban parameters proved to be an appropriate indirect measure of aerosol concentrations within the studied area. The potential locations for fixed air quality monitors are identified through clustering of areas (i.e., group of cells) with similar urban patterns. The typological center of each cluster corresponds to the most representative cell for all other cells in the cluster. In the studied neighborhood four different clusters were identified and for each cluster potential sites for air quality monitoring at ground level are identified.},

	abstract = {The Mexico City metropolitan area (MCMA) is a region that continues to grow in population and vehicular traffic as well as being the largest source of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) in Latin America. The local city government has made significant progress in controlling some of these pollutants, i.e., ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO), but particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and black carbon (BC) have shown a less positive response to mitigation strategies that have been in place for almost 3 decades. For the first time, extended measurements of equivalent black carbon (eBC), derived from light absorption measurements, have been made using a Photoacoustic Extinctiometer (PAX) over a 13 month period from March 2013 through March 2014. The daily trends in workdays (Monday through Saturday) and Sunday eBC, PM2.5 and the co-pollutants CO, O3 and NOx are evaluated with respect to the three primary seasons in the MCMA: rainy, cold and dry and warm and dry.




 The maximum values in all of the particle and gas concentrations were significantly larger (Student's t test, P {\textless} 0.05) during the dry periods than in the rainy season. The changes from rainy to dry seasons for eBC, PM2.5, CO, O3 and NOx were 8.8 to 13.1 μg m−3 (40 \%), 49 to 73 μg m−3 (40 \%), 2.5 to 3.8 ppm (40 \%), 73 to 100 ppb (30 \%) and 144 to 252 ppb (53 \%), respectively.


 The primary factors that lead to these large changes between the wet and dry seasons are the accelerated vertical mixing of boundary layer and free tropospheric air by the formation of clouds that dilutes the concentration of the SLCPs, the decreased actinic flux that reduces the production of ozone by photochemical reactions and the heavy, almost daily rain that removes particulate matter.


 A significant "weekend effect" was also identified, particularly the decrease in BC due to fewer large transport vehicles that are fueled by diesel, which produces a large fraction of the BC. The other co-pollutant concentrations are also significantly less on weekends except for O3 that shows no change in maximum values from workdays to Sundays. This lack of change is a result of the balancing effects of lower precursor gases, i.e., VOCs, offset by lower concentrations of NOx, that is an O3 inhibitor.


 A comparison of the average maximum value of eBC measured during the 1 year period of the current study, with maximum values measured in shorter field campaigns in 2000 and 2006, shows no significant change in the eBC emissions over a 14 year period. This suggests that new methods may need to be developed that can decrease potentially toxic levels of this particulate pollutant.},

	abstract = {In order to utilize satellite-based aerosol measurements for the determination of air quality, the relationship between aerosol optical properties (wavelength-dependent, column-integrated extinction measured by satellites) and mass measurements of aerosol loading (PM2.5 used for air quality monitoring) must be understood. This connection varies with many factors including those specific to the aerosol type, such as composition, size and hygroscopicity, and to the surrounding atmosphere, such as temperature, relative humidity (RH) and altitude, all of which can vary spatially and temporally. During the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) project, extensive in-situ atmospheric profiling in the Baltimore, MD–Washington, DC region was performed during fourteen flights in July 2011. Identical flight plans and profile locations throughout the project provide meaningful statistics for determining the variability in and correlations between aerosol loading, composition, optical properties and meteorological conditions.
 Measured water-soluble aerosol mass was composed primarily of ammonium sulfate (campaign average of 32 \%) and organics (57 \%). A distinct difference in composition was observed with high-loading days having a proportionally larger percentage of ammonium sulfate (up to 49 \%) due to transport from the Ohio River Valley. This composition shift caused a change in the aerosol water-uptake potential (hygroscopicity) such that higher relative contributions of ammonium sulfate increased the bulk aerosol hygroscopicity. These days also tended to have higher relative humidity causing an increase in the water content of the aerosol. Conversely, low aerosol loading days had lower ammonium sulfate and higher black carbon contributions causing lower single scattering albedos (SSAs). The average black carbon concentrations were 240 ng m−3 in the lowest 1 km decreasing to 35 ng m−3 in the free troposphere (above 3 km).
 Routine airborne sampling over six locations was used to evaluate the relative contributions of aerosol loading, composition, and relative humidity (the amount of water available for uptake onto aerosols) to variability in mixed layer aerosol. Aerosol loading was found to be the predominant source accounting for 88 \% on average of the measured spatial variability in extinction with lesser contributions from variability in relative humidity (10 \%) and aerosol composition (1.3 \%). On average, changes in aerosol loading also caused 82 \% of the diurnal variability in ambient aerosol extinction. However on days with relative humidity above 60 \%, variability in RH was found to cause up to 62 \% of the spatial variability and 95 \% of the diurnal variability in ambient extinction.
 This work shows that extinction is driven to first-order by aerosol mass loadings; however, humidity-driven hydration effects play an important secondary role. This motivates combined satellite/modelling assimilation products that are able to capture these components of the AOD-PM2.5 link. Conversely, aerosol hygroscopicity and SSA play a minor role in driving variations both spatially and throughout the day in aerosol extinction and therefore AOD. However, changes in aerosol hygroscopicity from day-to-day were large and could cause a bias of up to 27 \% if not accounted for. Thus it appears that a single daily measurement of aerosol hygroscopicity can be used for AOD-to-PM2.5 conversions over the study region (on the order of 1400 km2). This is complimentary to the results of Chu et al. (2015) that determined the aerosol vertical distribution from "a single lidar is feasible to cover the range of 100 km" in the same region.},

This technique was applied to high-time-resolution air pollutant measurements of in-use vehicle emissions performed under real-world conditions at a near-road monitoring station in Toronto, Canada, during four seasons, through month-long campaigns in 2013–2014. Based on carbon dioxide measurements, over 100 000 vehicle-related plumes were automatically identified and fuel-based emission factors for nitrogen oxides;  carbon monoxide;  particle number; black carbon;  benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX);  and methanol were determined for each plume. Thus the automated identification enabled the measurement of an unprecedented number of plumes and pollutants over an extended duration. Emission factors for volatile organic compounds were also measured roadside for the first time using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer;  this instrument provided the time resolution required for the plume capture technique. Mean emission factors were characteristic of the light-duty gasoline-dominated vehicle fleet present at the measurement site, with mean black carbon and particle number emission factors of 35 mg kg fuel−1 and 7.5 × 1014 \# kg fuel−1, respectively. The use of the plume-by-plume analysis enabled isolation of vehicle emissions, and the elucidation of co-emitted pollutants from similar vehicle types, variability of emissions across the fleet, and the relative contribution from heavy emitters. It was found that a small proportion of the fleet ({\textless} 25 \%) contributed significantly to total fleet emissions: 100, 100, 81, and 77 \% for black carbon, carbon monoxide, BTEX, and particle number, respectively. Emission factors of a single pollutant may help classify a vehicle as a high emitter;  however, regulatory strategies to more efficiently target multi-pollutant mixtures may be better developed by considering the co-emitted pollutants as well.},

	abstract = {Emissions inventories of black carbon (BC), which are traditionally constructed using a "bottom-up" approach based on activity data and emissions factors, are considered to contain a large level of uncertainty. In this paper, an ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) data assimilation technique is used to investigate the possibility of optimally recovering the spatially resolved emissions bias of BC. An inverse modeling system for emissions is established for an atmospheric chemistry aerosol model and two key problems related to ensemble data assimilation in the top-down emissions estimation are discussed: (1) how to obtain reasonable ensembles of prior emissions; and (2) establishing a scheme to localize the background-error matrix. An experiment involving a one month simulation cycle with EnOI inversion of BC emissions is performed for January 2008. The bias of the BC emissions intensity in China at each grid point is corrected by this inverse system. The inversed emission over China in January is 240.1 Gg, and annual emission is about 2750 Gg, which is over 1.8 times of bottom-up emission inventory. The results show that, even though only monthly mean BC measurements are employed to inverse the emissions, the accuracy of the daily model simulation improves. Using top-down emissions, the average root-mean-square error of simulated daily BC is decreased by nearly 30 \%. These results are valuable and promising for a better understanding of aerosol emissions and distributions, as well as aerosol forecasting.},

	abstract = {The reduction of ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a key objective for air pollution control policies in the UK and elsewhere. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 has been identified as a major contributor to adverse human health effects in epidemiological studies and underpins ambient PM2.5 legislation. As a range of emission sources and atmospheric chemistry transport processes contribute to PM2.5 concentrations, atmospheric chemistry transport models are an essential tool to assess emissions control effectiveness. The EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry transport model was used to investigate the impact of reductions in UK anthropogenic emissions of primary PM2.5, NH3, NOx, SOx or non-methane VOC on surface concentrations of PM2.5 in the UK for a recent year (2010) and for a future current legislation emission scenario (2030). In general, the sensitivity to UK mitigation is rather small. A 30 \% reduction in UK emissions of any one of the above components yields (for the 2010 simulation) a maximum reduction in PM2.5 in any given location of {\textasciitilde} 0.6 μg m−3 (equivalent to {\textasciitilde} 6 \% of the modelled PM2.5). On average across the UK, the sensitivity of PM2.5 concentrations to a 30 \% reduction in UK emissions of individual contributing components, for both the 2010 and 2030 CLE baselines, increases in the order NMVOC, NOx, SOx, NH3 and primary PM2.5, but there are strong spatial differences in the PM2.5 sensitivities across the UK. Consequently, the sensitivity of PM2.5 to individual component emissions reductions varies between area and population weighting. Reductions in NH3 have the greatest effect on area-weighted PM2.5. A full UK population weighting places greater emphasis on reductions of primary PM2.5 emissions, which is simulated to be the most effective single-component control on PM2.5 for the 2030 scenario. An important observation is that weighting corresponding to the Average Exposure Indicator metric (using data from the 45 model grids containing a monitor whose measurements are used to calculate the UK AEI) further increases the emphasis on the effectiveness of primary PM2.5 emissions reductions (and of NOx emissions reductions) relative to the effectiveness of NH3 emissions reductions. Reductions in primary PM2.5 have the largest impact on the AEI in both 2010 and the 2030 CLE scenario. The summation of the modelled reductions to the UK PM2.5 AEI from 30 \% reductions in UK emissions of primary PM2.5, NH3, SOx, NOx and VOC totals 1.17 and 0.82 μg m−3 for the 2010 and 2030 CLE simulations, respectively.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify drivers of environmental impact and quantify their influence on the environmental performance of wooden and massive residential and office buildings. We performed a life cycle assessment and used thermal simulation to quantify operational energy demand and to account for differences in thermal inertia of building mass. Twenty-eight input parameters, affecting operation, design, material, and exogenic building properties were sampled in a Monte Carlo analysis. To determine sensitivity, we calculated the correlation between each parameter and the resulting life cycle inventory and impact assessment scores. Parameters affecting operational energy demand and energy conversion are the most influential for the building?s total environmental performance. For climate change, electricity mix, ventilation rate, heating system, and construction material rank the highest. Thermal inertia results in an average 2?6\% difference in heat demand. Nonrenewable cumulative energy demand of wooden buildings is 18\% lower, compared to a massive variant. Total cumulative energy demand is comparable. The median climate change impact is 25\% lower, including end-of-life material credits and 22\% lower, when credits are excluded. The findings are valid for small offices and residential buildings in Switzerland and regions with similar building culture, construction material production, and climate.},

	abstract = {Spatial variations in urban air pollution are of considerable significance both because of the growing evidence for associations between exposure and human health and because of the increasing requirement for action to control and reduce levels of air pollution. This study examines sources and patterns of variation in NO2, as a marker for traffic-related pollution, in four predominantly urban study areas: Amsterdam (Netherlands), Huddersfield (UK), Poznan (Poland) and Prague (Czech Republic). Data on pollution levels were collected using passive samplers, deployed in duplicate for 2 week periods on four occasions over one year. Mixed-effect modelling was used to explore the magnitude of between-survey, between-site and between-sampler and interaction effects, and to provide a measure of mean annual concentration at each sample site. Measured concentrations varied significantly between different surveys, with a tendency to be higher in winter months. Strong correlations were seen, however, between monitored concentrations in successive surveys, suggesting that the geographic pattern of variation in all areas was essentially stable over time. Between-sampler variation was seen to be small (CV generally 5–8\%), indicating that the samplers provided consistent measures of NO2 concentrations. There were also strongly significant between-site and site–survey interaction effects. Between-site variation accounted for between 61\% (Poznan) and 84\% (Prague) of total observed variation; expressed as a coefficient of variation, between-site variation was least in Amsterdam, the smallest and most uniform study area (22\%), and greatest in Prague (42\%). The modelled mean annual NO2 concentration, derived from the mixed-effect model, gave a good prediction of mean annual concentration measured using passive samplers on a continuous basis, at 8–10 reference sites in each study area (r2\&gt;0.85). Based on the modelled results, it appears that WHO and national air quality standards for NO2 will be routinely exceeded at a number of sites in each study area. Given the apparent stability of the pollution surface in each area, these `hotspots’ are also likely to be persistent over time, implying the potential for relatively high risks of chronic exposure in local populations. Overall the results indicate the capability to characterise spatial variation in traffic-related pollution in urban areas using a small number of intensive surveys, with low-cost sampling devices.},

	abstract = {The literature on atmospheric particulate matter (PM), or atmospheric aerosol, has increased enormously over the last 2 decades and amounts now to some 1500–2000 papers per year in the refereed literature. This is in part due to the enormous advances in measurement technologies, which have allowed for an increasingly accurate understanding of the chemical composition and of the physical properties of atmospheric particles and of their processes in the atmosphere. The growing scientific interest in atmospheric aerosol particles is due to their high importance for environmental policy. In fact, particulate matter constitutes one of the most challenging problems both for air quality and for climate change policies. In this context, this paper reviews the most recent results within the atmospheric aerosol sciences and the policy needs, which have driven much of the increase in monitoring and mechanistic research over the last 2 decades.
 The synthesis reveals many new processes and developments in the science underpinning climate–aerosol interactions and effects of PM on human health and the environment. However, while airborne particulate matter is responsible for globally important influences on premature human mortality, we still do not know the relative importance of the different chemical components of PM for these effects. Likewise, the magnitude of the overall effects of PM on climate remains highly uncertain. Despite the uncertainty there are many things that could be done to mitigate local and global problems of atmospheric PM. Recent analyses have shown that reducing black carbon (BC) emissions, using known control measures, would reduce global warming and delay the time when anthropogenic effects on global temperature would exceed 2 °C. Likewise, cost-effective control measures on ammonia, an important agricultural precursor gas for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), would reduce regional eutrophication and PM concentrations in large areas of Europe, China and the USA. Thus, there is much that could be done to reduce the effects of atmospheric PM on the climate and the health of the environment and the human population.
 A prioritized list of actions to mitigate the full range of effects of PM is currently undeliverable due to shortcomings in the knowledge of aerosol science; among the shortcomings, the roles of PM in global climate and the relative roles of different PM precursor sources and their response to climate and land use change over the remaining decades of this century are prominent. In any case, the evidence from this paper strongly advocates for an integrated approach to air quality and climate policies.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies of long-term air pollution effects have been hampered by difficulties in characterizing the spatial variation in air pollution. We conducted a study to assess the risk of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution for the development of inhalant allergy and asthma in children in Stockholm county, Munich and the Netherlands. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution was assessed through a 1-year monitoring program and regression modeling using exposure indicators. This paper documents the performance of the exposure monitoring strategy and the spatial variation of ambient particle concentrations.

We measured the ambient concentration of PM2.5 and the reflectance of PM2.5 filters (‘soot’) at 40–42 sites representative of different exposure conditions of the three study populations. Each site was measured during four 14-day average sampling periods spread over one year (spring 1999 to summer 2000). In each study area, a continuous measurement site was operated to remove potential bias due to temporal variation.

The selected approach was an efficient method to characterize spatial differences in annual average concentration between a large number of sites in each study area. Adjustment with data from the continuous measurement site improved the precision of the calculated annual averages, especially for PM2.5. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 11 to 20 μg/m3 in Munich, from 8 to 16 μg/m3 in Stockholm and from 14 to 26 μg/m3 in the Netherlands. Larger spatial contrasts were found for the absorption coefficient of PM2.5. PM2.5 concentrations were on average 17–18\% higher at traffic sites than at urban background sites, but PM2.5 absorption coefficients at traffic sites were between 31\% and 55\% increased above background. This suggests that spatial variation of traffic-related air pollution may be underestimated if PM2.5 only is measured.},

In this study, radiocarbon (14C) based source apportionment is used to distinguish between fossil fuel and biomass burning sources of EC isolated from aerosol filter samples collected in Beijing from June 2010 to May 2011. The 14C results demonstrate that EC is consistently dominated by fossil-fuel combustion throughout the whole year with a mean contribution of 79\% ± 6\% (ranging from 70\% to 91\%), though EC has a higher mean and peak concentrations in the cold season. The seasonal molecular pattern of hopanes (i.e., a class of organic markers mainly emitted during the combustion of different fossil fuels) indicates that traffic-related emissions are the most important fossil source in the warm period and coal combustion emissions are significantly increased in the cold season. By combining 14C based source apportionment results and picene (i.e., an organic marker for coal emissions) concentrations, relative contributions from coal (mainly from residential bituminous coal) and vehicle to EC in the cold period were estimated as 25 ± 4\% and 50 ± 7\%, respectively, whereas the coal combustion contribution was negligible or very small in the warm period.},

In this study, we focused on a single (?subclinical response?) exposure to water-soluble extracts from PM collected at a roadside site in a major European city to elucidate potential components that drive pulmonary inflammatory, oxidative, and defense mechanisms and their systemic impacts. Intratracheal instillation (IT) of the aqueous extracts induced a 24 h inflammatory response characterized by increased broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells and cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), increased reactive oxygen species production, but insignificant lipids and proteins oxidation adducts in mouse lungs. This local response was largely self-resolved by 48 h, suggesting that it could represent a subclinical response to everyday-level exposure. Removal of soluble metals by chelation markedly diminished the pulmonary PM-mediated response. An artificial metal solution (MS) recapitulated the PM extract response. The self-resolving nature of the response is associated with activating defense mechanisms (increased levels of catalase and glutathione peroxidase expression), observed with both PM extract and MS. In conclusion, metals present in PM collected near roadways are largely responsible for the observed transient local pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress. Simultaneous activation of the antioxidant defense response may protect against oxidative damage.},

We extend our previous satellite methodology to the Mexico City area, a region with higher PM2.5 than most U.S. and European urban areas. Using a novel 1 km resolution AOD product from the MODIS instrument, we constructed daily predictions across the greater Mexico City area for 2004?2014. We calibrated the association of AOD to PM2.5 daily using municipal ground monitors, land use, and meteorological features. Predictions used spatial and temporal smoothing to estimate AOD when satellite data were missing. Our model performed well, resulting in an out-of-sample cross-validation R2 of 0.724. Cross-validated root-mean-squared prediction error (RMSPE) of the model was 5.55 ?g/m3.

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal variations of surface air pollutants (O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and PM10) with four land-use types: residence (R), commerce (C), industry (I) and greenbelt (G) have been investigated at 283 stations in South Korea during 2002–2013, using routinely observed data. The VOCs data at 9 photochemical pollutant monitoring stations available since 2007 were utilized in order to examine their effect on the ozone chemistry. The land-use types, set by the Korean government, were generally consistent with the satellite-derived land covers and with the previous result showing anti-correlation between O3 and NO2 in diverse urban areas. The relationship between the two pollutants in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) residence land-use areas was substantially different from that outside of the SMA, probably due to the local differences in vehicle emissions. The highest concentrations of air pollutants in the diurnal, weekly, and annual cycles were found in industry for SO2 and PM10, in commerce for NO2 and CO, and in greenbelt for O3, respectively. The concentrations of air pollutants, except for O3, were generally higher in big cities during weekdays while O3 showed its peak in suburban areas or small cities during weekends. The weekly cycle and trends of O3 were significantly out of phase with those of NO2, particularly in the residential and commercial areas, suggesting that vehicle emission was a major source in those areas. The ratios of VOCs to NO2 for each of the land-use types were in the order of I  (10.2) {\textgreater} C  (8.7)  {\textgreater} G  (3.9) {\textgreater} R  (3.6), suggesting that most areas in South Korea were likely to be VOCs-limited for ozone chemistry.  The pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and PM10) except for O3 have decreased most likely due to the effective government control. The total oxidant values (OX = O3 + NO2) with the land-use types were analyzed for the local and regional (or background) contributions of O3, respectively, and the order of OX (ppb) was C  (57.4)  {\textgreater} R  (53.6) {\textgreater} I  (50.7)  {\textgreater} G  (45.4), indicating the greenbelt observation was close to the background.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the impact of climate change on U.S. air quality and health in 2050 and 2100 using a global modeling framework and integrated economic, climate, and air pollution projections. Three internally consistent socioeconomic scenarios are used to value health benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation policies specifically derived from slowing climate change. Our projections suggest that climate change, exclusive of changes in air pollutant emissions, can significantly impact ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution across the U.S. and increase associated health effects. Climate policy can substantially reduce these impacts, and climate-related air pollution health benefits alone can offset a significant fraction of mitigation costs. We find that in contrast to cobenefits from reductions to coemitted pollutants, the climate-induced air quality benefits of policy increase with time and are largest between 2050 and 2100. Our projections also suggest that increasing climate policy stringency beyond a certain degree may lead to diminishing returns relative to its cost. However, our results indicate that the air quality impacts of climate change are substantial and should be considered by cost-benefit climate policy analyses.},

Our analysis uses high-resolution (10 km, global-coverage) concentration data and cause-specific integrated exposure-response (IER) functions developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 to assess how regional and global improvements in ambient air quality could reduce attributable mortality from PM2.5. Overall, an aggressive global program of PM2.5 mitigation in line with WHO interim guidelines could avoid 750?000 (23\%) of the 3.2 million deaths per year currently (ca. 2010) attributable to ambient PM2.5. Modest improvements in PM2.5 in relatively clean regions (North America, Europe) would result in surprisingly large avoided mortality, owing to demographic factors and the nonlinear concentration-response relationship that describes the risk of particulate matter in relation to several important causes of death. In contrast, major improvements in air quality would be required to substantially reduce mortality from PM2.5 in more polluted regions, such as China and India. Moreover, forecasted demographic and epidemiological transitions in India and China imply that to keep PM2.5-attributable mortality rates (deaths per 100?000 people per year) constant, average PM2.5 levels would need to decline by ?20?30\% over the next 15 years merely to offset increases in PM2.5-attributable mortality from aging populations. An effective program to deliver clean air to the world?s most polluted regions could avoid several hundred thousand premature deaths each year.},

	abstract = {A new aerosol dynamics model (DMANx) has been developed that simulates aerosol size/composition distribution and includes the condensation of organic vapors on nanoparticles through the implementation of the recently developed volatility basis set framework. Simulations were performed for Hyytiälä (Finland) and Finokalia (Greece), two locations with different organic sources where detailed measurements were available to constrain the new model. We investigate the effect of condensation of organics and chemical aging reactions of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors on ultrafine particle growth and particle number concentration during a typical springtime nucleation event in both locations. This work highlights the importance of the pathways of oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds and the production of extremely low volatility organics. At Hyytiälä, organic condensation dominates the growth process of new particles. The low-volatility SOA contributes to particle growth during the early growth stage, but after a few hours most of the growth is due to semi-volatile SOA. At Finokalia, simulations show that organics have a complementary role in new particle growth, contributing 45\% to the total mass of new particles. Condensation of organics increases the number concentration of particles that can act as CCN (cloud condensation nuclei) (N100) by 13\% at Finokalia and 25\% at Hyytiälä during a typical spring day with nucleation. The sensitivity of our results to the surface tension used is discussed.},

The aggregated results provide EFs for BC, NOx and PN for three vehicle categories: goods vehicles, gasoline and diesel passenger cars. This is the first on-road measurement study where BC EFs of numerous individual diesel cars were determined in real-world driving conditions. We found good agreement between EFs of goods vehicles determined in this campaign and the results of previous studies that used either chasing or remote sensing measurement techniques. The composition of the sampled car fleet determined from the national vehicle registry information is reflective of Eurostat statistical data on the Slovenian and European vehicle fleet. The median BC EF of diesel and gasoline cars that were in use for less than 5 years, decreased by 60 and 47\% from those in use for 5–10 years, respectively, the median NOx and PN EFs, of goods vehicles that were in use for less than five years, decreased from those in use for 5–10 years by 52 and 67\%, respectively. The influence of engine maximum power of the measured EFs showed an increase in NOx EF from least to more powerful vehicles with diesel engines. Finally a disproportionate contribution of high emitters to the total emissions of the measured fleet was found; the top 25\% of emitting diesel cars contributed 63, 47 and 61\% of BC, NOx and PN emissions respectively. With the combination of relatively simple on-road measurements with sophisticated post processing individual vehicles EF can be determined and useful information about the fleet emissions can be obtained by exactly representing vehicles which contribute disproportionally to vehicle fleet emissions; and monitor how the numerous emission reduction approaches are reflected in on-road driving conditions.},

Quantifying pollutant concentrations from these cookstoves during different phases of operation and understanding the factors influencing their variability may help to identify where improvements should be targeted, enhancing indoor air quality for millions of the world?s most vulnerable people. Gas and particulate measurements were collected between June and August, 2012, for 51 households using traditional cookstoves, in the villages of Udaipur district, Rajasthan, India. Mean pollutant concentrations during steady-state mode were 4989 ?m2 cm?3, 9835 ?g m?3, and 18.5 ppm for lung-deposited surface area, PM2.5, and CO, respectively. Simple and multivariate regression analysis was conducted. Fuel amount, fuel diameter, duration of the cookstove run, roof-type, and the room dimension explained between 7\% and 21\% of the variability for the pollutant metrics. CO demonstrated weaker correlations with explanatory variables. Some of these variables may be indicative of socio-economic status and could be used as proxies of exposure in lieu of pollutant measurements, hence these variables may help identify which households to prioritize for intervention. Such associations should be further explored.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a summary of the work done within the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ECLIPSE (Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants). ECLIPSE had a unique systematic concept for designing a realistic and effective mitigation scenario for short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs: methane, aerosols and ozone, and their precursor species) and quantifying its climate and air quality impacts, and this paper presents the results in the context of this overarching strategy. The first step in ECLIPSE was to create a new emission inventory based on current legislation (CLE) for the recent past and until 2050. Substantial progress compared to previous work was made by including previously unaccounted types of sources such as flaring of gas associated with oil production, and wick lamps. These emission data were used for present-day reference simulations with four advanced Earth system models (ESMs) and six chemistry transport models (CTMs). The model simulations were compared with a variety of ground-based and satellite observational data sets from Asia, Europe and the Arctic. It was found that the models still underestimate the measured seasonality of aerosols in the Arctic but to a lesser extent than in previous studies. Problems likely related to the emissions were identified for Northern Russia and India, in particular. To estimate the climate impacts of SLCPs, ECLIPSE followed two paths of research: the first path calculated radiative forcing (RF) values for a large matrix of SLCP species emissions, for different seasons and regions independently. Based on these RF calculations, the Global Temperature change Potential metric for a time horizon of 20 years (GTP20) was calculated for each SLCP emission type. This climate metric was then used in an integrated assessment model to identify all emission mitigation measures with a beneficial air quality and short-term (20 year) climate impact. These measures together defined a SLCP mitigation (MIT) scenario. Compared to CLE, the MIT scenario would reduce global methane (CH4) and black carbon emissions by about 50 and 80\%, respectively. For CH4, measures on shale gas production, waste management and coal mines were most important. For non-CH4 SLCPs, elimination of high emitting vehicles and wick lamps, as well as reducing emissions from gas flaring, coal and biomass stoves, agricultural waste, solvents and diesel engines were most important. These measures lead to large reductions in calculated surface concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. We estimate that in the EU the loss of statistical life expectancy due to air pollution was 7.5 months in 2010, which will be reduced to 5.2 months by 2030 in the CLE scenario. The MIT scenario would reduce this value by another 0.9 to 4.3 months. Substantially larger reductions due to the mitigation are found for China (1.8 months) and India (11–12 months). The climate metrics cannot fully quantify the climate response. Therefore, a second research path was taken. Transient climate ensemble simulations with these ESMs were run for the CLE and MIT scenarios, to determine the climate impacts of the mitigation. In these simulations, the CLE scenario resulted in a surface temperature increase of 0.70±0.14 K between the years 2006 and 2050. For the decade 2041–2050, the warming was reduced by 0.22±0.07 K in the MIT scenario, and this result was in almost exact agreement with the response calculated based on the emission metrics (reduced warming of 0.22±0.09 K). The metrics calculations suggest that non-CH4 SLCPs contribute ∼22\% to this response and CH4 78\%. This could not be fully confirmed by the transient simulations, which attributed about 90\% of the temperature response to CH4 reductions. Attribution of the observed temperature response to non-CH4 SLCP emission reductions and black carbon (BC) specifically is hampered in the transient simulations by small forcing and co-emitted species of the emission basket chosen. Nevertheless, an important conclusion is that our mitigation basket as a whole would lead to clear benefits for both air quality and climate. The climate response from BC reductions in our study is smaller than reported previously, largely because our study is one of the first to use fully coupled climate models, where unforced variability and sea-ice responses may counteract the impacts of small emission reductions. The temperature responses to the mitigation were generally stronger over the continents than over the oceans, and with a warming reduction of 0.44 K (0.39–0.49) largest over the Arctic. Our calculations suggest particularly beneficial climate responses in Southern Europe, where the surface warming was reduced by about 0.3 K and precipitation rates were increased by about 15 (6–21) mm yr-1 (more than 4\% of total precipitation) from spring to autumn. Thus, the mitigation could help to alleviate expected future drought and water shortages in the Mediterranean area. We also report other important results of the ECLIPSE project.},

The impact of high pollutant concentrations, in particular of aerosol particles, on human health is of major concern. The present study uses aerosol optical depth (AOD) as proxy to estimate long-term PM2.5 and subsequently estimates the premature mortality due to PM2.5. We use the AOD from 2001 to 2012 from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in Beijing and the ground-based PM2.5 observations from the US embassy in Beijing from 2010 to 2011 to establish a relationship between PM2.5 and AOD. By including the atmospheric boundary layer height and relative humidity in the comparative analysis, the correlation (R2) increases from 0.28 to 0.62. We evaluate 12 years of PM2.5 data for the Beijing central area using an estimated linear relationship with AOD and calculate the yearly premature mortality by different diseases attributable to PM2.5. The estimated average total mortality due to PM2.5 is about 5100 individuals per year for the period 2001–2012 in the Beijing central area, and for the period 2010–2012 the per capita mortality for all ages due to PM2.5 is around 15 per 10 000 person-years, which underscores the urgent need for air pollution abatement.},

However, recent studies worldwide have shown that – in high-insolation urban regions at least – new particle formation events can also contribute to UFP. In order to quantify such events we systematically studied three cities located in predominantly sunny environments: Barcelona (Spain), Madrid (Spain) and Brisbane (Australia). Three long-term data sets (1–2 years) of fine and ultrafine particle number size distributions (measured by SMPS, Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer) were analysed. Compared to total particle number concentrations, aerosol size distributions offer far more information on the type, origin and atmospheric evolution of the particles. By applying k-means clustering analysis, we categorized the collected aerosol size distributions into three main categories: "Traffic" (prevailing 44–63\% of the time), "Nucleation" (14–19\%) and "Background pollution and Specific cases" (7–22\%). Measurements from Rome (Italy) and Los Angeles (USA) were also included to complement the study. The daily variation of the average UFP concentrations for a typical nucleation day at each site revealed a similar pattern for all cities, with three distinct particle bursts. A morning and an evening spike reflected traffic rush hours, whereas a third one at midday showed nucleation events. The photochemically nucleated particles' burst lasted 1–4 h, reaching sizes of 30–40 nm. On average, the occurrence of particle size spectra dominated by nucleation events was 16\% of the time, showing the importance of this process as a source of UFP in urban environments exposed to high solar radiation. Nucleation events lasting for 2 h or more occurred on 55\% of the days, this extending to {\textgreater} 4 h in 28\% of the days, demonstrating that atmospheric conditions in urban environments are not favourable to the growth of photochemically nucleated particles. In summary, although traffic remains the main source of UFP in urban areas, in developed countries with high insolation urban nucleation events are also a main source of UFP. If traffic-related particle concentrations are reduced in the future, nucleation events will likely increase in urban areas, due to the reduced urban condensation sinks.},

Seven consecutive 24-h PM1 samples were collected during winter and summer 2010 in a total of 74 nonsmoking homes in Edmonton, Canada. Median winter concentrations of PM1 were 2.2 ?g/m3 (interquartile range, IQR = 0.8?6.1 ?g/m3) and 3.3 ?g/m3 (IQR = 1.5?6.9 ?g/m3) for indoors and outdoors, respectively. In the summer, indoor (median 4.4 ?g/m3, IQR = 2.4?8.6 ?g/m3) and outdoor (median 4.3 ?g/m3, IQR = 2.6?7.4 ?g/m3) levels were similar. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to identify and apportion indoor and outdoor sources of elements in PM1 mass. Nine sources contributing to both indoor and outdoor PM1 concentrations were identified including secondary sulfate, soil, biomass smoke and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), traffic, settled and mixed dust, coal combustion, road salt/road dust, and urban mixture. Three additional indoor sources were identified i.e., carpet dust, copper-rich, and silver-rich. Secondary sulfate, soil, biomass smoke and ETS contributed more than 70\% (indoors: 0.29 ?g/m3, outdoors: 0.39 ?g/m3) of measured elemental mass in PM1. These findings can aid understanding of relationships between submicron particles and health outcomes for indoor/outdoor sources.},

	abstract = {Substantial anthropogenic emissions from China have resulted in serious air pollution, and this has generated considerable academic and public concern. The physical transport of air pollutants in the atmosphere has been extensively investigated; however, understanding the mechanisms how the pollutant was transferred through economic and trade activities remains a challenge. For the first time, we quantified and tracked China's air pollutant emission flows embodied in interprovincial trade, using a multiregional input–output model framework. Trade relative emissions for four key air pollutants (primary fine particle matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and non-methane volatile organic compounds) were assessed for 2007 in each Chinese province. We found that emissions were significantly redistributed among provinces owing to interprovincial trade. Large amounts of emissions were embodied in the imports of eastern regions from northern and central regions, and these were determined by differences in regional economic status and environmental policy. It is suggested that measures should be introduced to reduce air pollution by integrating cross-regional consumers and producers within national agreements to encourage efficiency improvement in the supply chain and optimize consumption structure internationally. The consumption-based air pollutant emission inventory developed in this work can be further used to attribute pollution to various economic activities and final demand types with the aid of air quality models.},

Improved stoves, especially some modern gasifier biomass models, are being deployed to alleviate household and ambient air pollution. Pollutant emissions from coal burning in improved metal stoves (n = 11) and wood combustion in modern gasifier stoves (n = 8) were measured in field in Hubei, China. The emissions of CO, TSP, OC, EC, and PAHs from coal burning in the improved iron stoves were generally lower than previously reported results for coal in traditional stoves. For pollutants from wood combustion in the gasifier stoves, the emissions were less than literature-reported values for wood burned in traditional stoves, comparable to those in improved stoves, but appeared to be higher than those for pellets in gasifier stoves in laboratory tests. The limitations of scarce data and large variances result in statistical insignificance. Daily emissions of targeted pollutants per household were found to be higher for wood burners, compared with households relying on coal. The gasifier stove had relatively high thermal efficiencies, but emissions of most air pollutants per delivered energy were not significantly different from those from the coal burning in improved iron stoves. Moreover, higher emissions of OC, EC, and PAHs were observed, indicating that caution and additional testing will be needed while designing future clean cookstove intervention programs.},

It is based on modal aerosol dynamics modeling with log-normal assumption of particle distributions. The model has an Eulerian sub-model providing detailed spatial information within the computational domain and a computationally less expensive, but spatial-information-lacking, Lagrangian sub-model. Particle formation in a laboratory sampling system that includes a porous tube-type diluter and an aging chamber was modeled with CFD-TUTEAM. The simulation results imply that over 99\% of new particles are formed in the aging chamber region because the nucleation rate remains at a high level in the aging chamber due to low dilution ratio and low nucleation exponents. The nucleation exponents for sulfuric acid in sulfuric-acid–water nucleation ranging from 0.25 to 1 appeared to fit best with measurement data, which are the same values as obtained from the slopes of the measured volatile nucleation mode number concentration vs. the measured raw exhaust sulfuric acid concentration. These nucleation exponents are very low compared to the nucleation exponents obtained from the classical nucleation theory of binary sulfuric-acid–water nucleation. The values of nucleation exponent lower than unity suggest that other compounds, such as hydrocarbons, might have a significant role in the nucleation process.},

We tested transferability and generalizability of spatial-temporal LUR models of hourly particle number concentration (PNC) for Boston-area (MA, U.S.A.) urban neighborhoods near Interstate 93. Four neighborhood-specific regression models and one Boston-area model were developed from mobile monitoring measurements (34?46 days/neighborhood over one year each). Transferability was tested by applying each neighborhood-specific model to the other neighborhoods; generalizability was tested by applying the Boston-area model to each neighborhood. Both the transferability and generalizability of models were tested with and without neighborhood-specific calibration. Important PNC predictors (adjusted-R2 = 0.24?0.43) included wind speed and direction, temperature, highway traffic volume, and distance from the highway edge. Direct model transferability was poor (R2 {\textless} 0.17). Locally-calibrated transferred models (R2 = 0.19?0.40) and the Boston-area model (adjusted-R2 = 0.26, range: 0.13?0.30) performed similarly to neighborhood-specific models; however, some coefficients of locally calibrated transferred models were uninterpretable. Our results show that transferability of neighborhood-specific LUR models of hourly PNC was limited, but that a general model performed acceptably in multiple areas when calibrated with local data.},

	abstract = {The implications of Stein?s paradox stirred considerable debate in statistical circles when the concept was first introduced in the 1950s. The paradox arises when we are interested in estimating the means of several variables simultaneously. In this situation, the best estimator for an individual mean, the sample average, is no longer the best. Rather, a shrinkage estimator, which shrinks individual sample averages toward the overall average is shown to have improved overall accuracy. Although controversial at the time, the concept of shrinking toward overall average is now widely accepted as a good practice for improving statistical stability and reducing error, not only in simple estimation problems, but also in complicated modeling problems. However, the utility of Stein?s insights are not widely recognized in the environmental management community, where mean pollutant concentrations of multiple waters are routinely estimated for management decision-making. In this essay, we introduce Stein?s paradox and its modern generalization, the Bayesian hierarchical model, in the context of environmental standard compliance assessment. Using simulated data and nutrient monitoring data from wadeable streams around the Great Lakes, we show that a Bayesian hierarchical model can improve overall estimation accuracy, thereby improving our confidence in the assessment results, especially for standard compliance assessment of waters with small sample sizes.},

Although most PM measurements for determining compliance with standards are taken over 24-h periods every third to sixth day, outdoor human exposure assessment requires measurements taken continuously throughout the day, preferably over durations of 1 h or less. More detailed particle size and chemistry data are also desirable, as smaller size fractions and specific chemicals may be better indicators of adverse health effects than total mass samples.},

 As part of the September 2011 joint PM-DRIVE (Particulate Matter – DiRect and Indirect on-road Vehicular Emissions) and MOCOPO (Measuring and mOdeling traffic COngestion and POllution) field campaign, the concentration and high-resolution chemical composition of aerosols and volatile organic carbon species were measured adjacent to a major urban highway south of Grenoble, France. Alongside these atmospheric measurements, detailed traffic data were collected from nearby traffic cameras and loop detectors, which allowed the vehicle type, traffic concentration, and traffic speed to be quantified. Six aerosol age and source profiles were resolved using the positive matrix factorization  model on real-time high-resolution aerosol mass spectra. These six aerosol source/age categories included a hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) commonly associated with primary vehicular emissions, a nitrogen-containing aerosol with a diurnal pattern similar to that of HOA, oxidized organic aerosol (OOA), and biomass burning aerosol. While quantitatively separating the influence of diesel from that of gasoline proved impossible, a low HOA : black carbon ratio, similar to that measured in other high-diesel environments, and high levels of NOx, also indicative of diesel emissions, were observed. Although the measurement site was located next to a large source of primary emissions, which are typically found to have low oxygen incorporation, OOA was found to comprise the majority of the measured organic aerosol, and isotopic analysis showed that the measured OOA contained mainly modern carbon, not fossil-derived carbon. Thus, even in this heavily vehicular-emission-impacted environment, photochemical processes, biogenic emissions, and aerosol oxidation dominated the overall organic aerosol mass measured during most of the campaign.},

One possible alternative measurement approach evaluated to support the implementation of the LEV III standards is integrated particle size distribution (IPSD), which reports real-time PM mass using size distribution and effective density. The IPSD method was evaluated using TSI?s engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS, 5.6?560 nm) and gravimetric filter data from more than 250 tests and 34 vehicles at ARB?s Haagen-Smit Laboratory (HSL). IPSD mass was persistently lower than gravimetric mass by 56?75\% over the FTP tests and by 81?84\% over the supplemental FTP (US06) tests. Strong covariance between the methods suggests test-to-test variability originates from actual vehicle emission differences rather than measurement accuracy, where IPSD offered no statistical improvement over gravimetric measurement variability.},

Future meteorology was downscaled from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE General Circulation Model (GCM) to the regional scale using the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model. We use emissions growth factors from the EPAUS9r MARKAL model to project emissions inventories for two climate tax scenarios, a combined transportation and energy scenario, a biomass energy scenario and a reference case. Implementation of a relatively aggressive carbon tax leads to improved PM2.5 air quality compared to the reference case as incentives increase for facilities to install flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies. However, less capital is available to install NOX reduction technologies, resulting in an O3 increase. A policy aimed at reducing CO2 from the transportation sector and electricity production sectors leads to reduced emissions of mobile source NOX, thus reducing O3. Over most of the U.S., this scenario leads to reduced PM2.5 concentrations. However, increased primary PM2.5 emissions associated with fuel switching in the residential and industrial sectors leads to increased organic matter (OM) and PM2.5 in some cities.},

Our goal was to evaluate the influence of time-activity adjustment on exposure assignment and associations with blood biomarkers for a near-highway population. A regression model based on mobile monitoring and spatial and temporal variables was used to generate hourly ambient residential PNC for a full year for a subset of participants (n=140) in the Community Assessment of Freeway Exposure and Health study. We modified the ambient estimates for each hour using personal estimates of hourly time spent in five micro-environments (inside home, outside home, at work, commuting, other) as well as particle infiltration. Time-activity adjusted (TAA)-PNC values differed from residential ambient annual average (RAA)-PNC, with lower exposures predicted for participants who spent more time away from home. Employment status and distance to highway had a differential effect on TAA-PNC. We found associations of RAA-PNC with high sensitivity C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6, although exposure-response functions were non-monotonic. TAA-PNC associations had larger effect estimates and linear exposure-response functions. Our findings suggest that time-activity adjustment improves exposure assessment for air pollutants that vary greatly in space and time.},

	abstract = {Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) may have adverse health effects. Central monitoring stations do not represent the personal exposure to UFP accurately. Few studies have previously focused on personal exposure to UFP. Sixty non-smoking residents living in Copenhagen, Denmark were asked to carry a backpack equipped with a portable monitor, continuously recording particle number concentrations (PN), in order to measure the real-time individual exposure over a period of ∼48 h. A GPS logger was carried along with the particle monitor and allowed us to estimate the contribution of UFP exposure occurring in various microenvironments (residence, during active and passive transport, other indoor and outdoor environments) to the total daily exposure. On average, the fractional contribution of each microenvironment to the daily integrated personal exposure roughly corresponded to the fractions of the day the subjects spent in each microenvironment. The home environment accounted for 50\% of the daily personal exposure. Indoor environments other than home or vehicles contributed with ∼40\%. The highest median UFP concentration was obtained during passive transport (vehicles). However, being in transit or outdoors contributed 5\% or less to the daily exposure. Additionally, the subjects recorded in a diary the periods when they were at home. With this approach, 66\% of the total daily exposure was attributable to the home environment. The subjects spent 28\% more time at home according to the diary, compared to the GPS. These results may indicate limitations of using diaries, but also possible inaccuracy and miss-classification in the GPS data.},

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a consistent increased risk for cardiovascular events in relation to both short- and long-term exposure to present-day concentrations of ambient particulate matter. Several plausible mechanistic pathways have been described, including enhanced coagulation/thrombosis, a propensity for arrhythmias, acute arterial vasoconstriction, systemic inflammatory responses, and the chronic promotion of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this statement is to provide healthcare professionals and regulatory agencies with a comprehensive review of the literature on air pollution and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the implications of these findings in relation to public health and regulatory policies are addressed. Practical recommendations for healthcare providers and their patients are outlined. In the final section, suggestions for future research are made to address a number of remaining scientific questions.},

	abstract = {In many areas of the world, concentrations of ambient air pollutants exceed levels associated with increased risk of acute and chronic health problems. While effective policies to reduce emissions at their sources are clearly preferable, some evidence supports the effectiveness of individual actions to reduce exposure and health risks. Personal exposure to ambient air pollution can be reduced on high air pollution days by staying indoors, reducing outdoor air infiltration to indoors, cleaning indoor air with air filters, and limiting physical exertion, especially outdoors and near air pollution sources. Limited evidence suggests that the use of respirators may be effective in some circumstances. Awareness of air pollution levels is facilitated by a growing number of public air quality alert systems. Avoiding exposure to air pollutants is especially important for susceptible individuals with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, children, and the elderly. Research on mechanisms underlying the adverse health effects of air pollution have suggested potential pharmaceutical or chemopreventive interventions, such as antioxidant or antithrombotic agents, but in the absence of data on health outcomes, no sound recommendations can be made for primary prevention. Health care providers and their patients should carefully consider individual circumstances related to outdoor and indoor air pollutant exposure levels and susceptibility to those air pollutants when deciding on a course of action to reduce personal exposure and health risks from ambient air pollutants. Careful consideration is especially warranted when interventions may have unintended negative consequences, such as when efforts to avoid exposure to air pollutants lead to reduced physical activity or when there is evidence that dietary supplements, such as antioxidants, have potential adverse health effects. These potential complications of partially effective personal interventions to reduce exposure or risk highlight the primary importance of reducing emissions of air pollutants at their sources.},

	abstract = {Human impacts on Earth are now so great that they have led to the concept of a new geological epoch defined by this global human influence: the Anthropocene. While not universally accepted, the term is increasingly popular and widely used. However, even among proponents, there is considerable debate regarding when the epoch may have started, from coeval with the Holocene, through the Industrial Revolution, to the mid-20th century when unprecedented human activities resulted in exponential increases in population, resource consumption, and pollutant emission. Recently, this latter period, known as the Great Acceleration, appears to be becoming the more widely accepted start date. To define any start point, a global stratigraphic marker or Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) is typically required. Here, spheroidal carbonaceous fly ash particles (SCPs), byproducts of industrial fossil-fuel combustion, are proposed as a primary marker for a GSSP at the time of the Great Acceleration. Data from over 75 lake sediment records show a global, synchronous, and dramatic increase in particle accumulation starting in c. 1950 driven by the increased demand for electricity and the introduction of fuel-oil combustion, in addition to coal, as a means to produce it. SCPs are morphologically distinct and solely anthropogenic in origin, providing an unambiguous marker.

	abstract = {Using surface meteorological observation and high resolution emission data, this paper discusses the application of PLAM/h Index (Parameter Linking Air-quality to Meteorological conditions/haze) in the prediction of large-scale low visibility and fog-haze events. Based on the two-dimensional probability density function diagnosis model for emissions, the study extends the diagnosis and prediction of the meteorological pollution index PLAM to the regional visibility fog-haze intensity. The results show that combining the influence of regular meteorological conditions and emission factors together in the PLAM/h parameterization scheme is very effective in improving the diagnostic identification ability of the fog-haze weather in North China. The correlation coefficients for four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) between PLAM/h and visibility observation are 0.76, 0.80, 0.96 and 0.86 respectively and all their significance levels exceed 0.001, showing the ability of PLAM/h to predict the seasonal changes and differences of fog-haze weather in the North China region. The high-value correlation zones are respectively located in Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei), Bohai Bay rim and the southern Hebei-northern Henan, indicating that the PLAM/h index has relations with the distribution of frequent heavy fog-haze weather in North China and the distribution of emission high-value zone. Comparatively analyzing the heavy fog-haze events and large-scale fine weather processes in winter and summer, it is found that PLAM/h index 24 h forecast is highly correlated to the visibility observation.  Therefore, PLAM/h index has better capability of doing identification, analysis and forecasting.},

	abstract = {The formation of new aerosol particles in the atmosphere is a key process influencing the aerosol number concentration as well as the climate, in particular at high altitude, where the newly formed particles directly influence cloud formation. However, free tropospheric new particle formation (NPF) is poorly documented due to logistic limitations and complex atmospheric dynamics around high-altitude stations that make the observation of this day-time process challenging. Recent improvements in measurement techniques make now possible the detection of neutral clusters down to {\textasciitilde} 1 nm sizes, which opens new horizons in our understanding of the nucleation process. Indeed, only the charged fraction of clusters has been reported in the upper troposphere up to now. Here we report day-time concentrations of charged and neutral clusters (1 to 2.5 nm mobility diameter) recorded at the interface between the boundary layer (BL) and the FT as well as in the FT at the altitude site of Puy de Dôme  (1465 m a.s.l.), central France, between 10 and 29 February  2012. Our findings demonstrate that in the FT, and especially at the interface between the BL and the FT, the formation of 1.5 nm neutral clusters significantly exceeds the one of ionic clusters during NPF events, clearly indicating that they dominate in the nucleation process. We also observe that the total cluster concentration significantly increases during NPF events compared to the other days, which was not clearly observed for the charged cluster population in the past. During the studied period, the nucleation process does not seem to be sulfuric acid-limited and could be promoted by the transport of pollutants to the upper troposphere, coupled with low temperatures.},

PM2.5 is produced by a variety of direct and indirect, natural and anthropogenic processes that complicate PM2.5 management. This study develops a proof-of-concept method to quantify the effects on global premature mortality of changes to PM2.5 precursor emissions. Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we calculated sensitivities of global PM2.5-related premature mortality to emissions of precursor gases (SO2, NOx, NH3) and carbonaceous aerosols. We used a satellite-derived ground-level PM2.5 data set at approximately 10 ? 10 km2 resolution to better align the exposure with population density. We used exposure-response functions from the GBD project to relate mortality to exposure in the adjoint calculation. The response of global mortality to changes in local anthropogenic emissions varied spatially by several orders of magnitude. The largest reductions in mortality for a 1 kg km?2 yr?1 decrease in emissions were for ammonia and carbonaceous aerosols in Eastern Europe. The greatest reductions in mortality for a 10\% decrease in emissions were found for secondary inorganic sources in East Asia. In general, a 10\% decrease in SO2 emissions was the most effective source to control, but regional exceptions were found.},

	abstract = {Determining the contribution of wood smoke to air pollution in large cities such as London is becoming increasingly important due to the changing nature of domestic heating in urban areas. During winter, biomass burning emissions have been identified as a major cause of exceedances of European air quality limits. The aim of this work was to quantify the contribution of biomass burning in London to concentrations of PM2.5 and determine whether local emissions or regional contributions were the main source of biomass smoke. To achieve this, a number of biomass burning chemical tracers were analysed at a site within central London and two sites in surrounding rural areas. Concentrations of levoglucosan, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and K+ were generally well correlated across the three sites. At all the sites, biomass burning was found to be a source of OC and EC, with the largest contribution of EC from traffic emissions, while for OC the dominant fraction included contributions from secondary organic aerosols, primary biogenic and cooking sources. Source apportionment of the EC and OC was found to give reasonable estimation of the total carbon from non-fossil and fossil fuel sources based upon comparison with estimates derived from 14C analysis. Aethalometer-derived black carbon data were also apportioned into the contributions from biomass burning and traffic and showed trends similar to those observed for EC. Mean wood smoke mass at the sites was estimated to range from 0.78 to 1.0 μg m−3 during the campaign in January–February 2012. Measurements on a 160 m tower in London suggested a similar ratio of brown to black carbon (reflecting wood burning and traffic respectively) in regional and London air. Peaks in the levoglucosan and K+ concentrations were observed to coincide with low ambient temperature, consistent with domestic heating as a major contributing local source in London. Overall, the source of biomass smoke in London was concluded to be a background regional source overlaid by contributions from local domestic burning emissions. This could have implications when considering future emission control strategies during winter and may be the focus of future work in order to better determine the contributing local sources.},

Yet, few field based studies document BC concentration reductions (and resulting human exposure) resulting from improved stove usage. In this paper, data are presented from 277 real-world cooking sessions collected during two field studies to document the impacts on indoor BC concentrations inside village kitchens as a result of switching from traditional stoves to improved forced draft (FD) stoves. Data collection utilized new low-cost cellphone methods to monitor BC, cooking duration, and fuel consumption. A cross sectional study recorded a reduction of 36\% in BC during cooking sessions. An independent paired sample study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 40\% in 24 h BC concentrations when traditional stoves were replaced with FD stoves. Reductions observed in these field studies differ from emission factor reductions (up to 99\%) observed under controlled conditions in laboratory studies. Other nonstove sources (e.g., kerosene lamps, ambient concentrations) likely offset the reductions. Health exposure studies should utilize reductions determined by field measurements inside village kitchens, in conjunction with laboratory data, to assess the health impacts of new cooking technologies.},

The paper will be useful to governments and public agencies considering using geographic crowdsourcing in the future.  We begin by defining VGI, CS, PM and crowdsourcing.  Two typologies are then offered as methods to conceptualize these practices and the Kitchin (2014) data assemblage framework is proposed as a method by which state actors can critically examine their data infrastructures.  A selection of exemplary VGI, CS and PM from Canada and the Republic of Ireland are discussed and the paper concludes with some high level recommendations for administrations considering a geographic approach to crowdsourcing.},

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model routinely underpredicts peak ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. Temporal misallocation of electricity sector emissions contributes to this modeling deficiency. Hourly emissions are created for CMAQ by use of temporal profiles applied to annual emission totals unless a source is matched to a continuous emissions monitor (CEM) in the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). More than 53\% of CEMs in the Pennsylvania?New Jersey?Maryland (PJM) electricity market and 45\% nationally are unmatched in the 2008 NEI. For July 2006, a United States heat wave with high electricity demand, peak electric sector emissions, and elevated ambient PM2.5 mass, we match hourly emissions for 267 CEM/NEI pairs in PJM (approximately 49\% and 12\% of unmatched CEMs in PJM and nationwide) using state permits, electricity dispatch modeling and CEMs. Hourly emissions for individual facilities can differ up to 154\% during the simulation when measurement data is used rather than default temporalization values.

We first developed a LUR model for NOx using annual averages of NOx at all available air quality monitoring sites in Israel between 1991 and 2011 with time as one of the independent variables. We then reconstructed historical spatial data (e.g., road network) from historical topographic maps to apply the model?s prediction to each year from 1961 to 2011. The model?s predictions were then validated against independent estimates about the national annual NOx emissions from on-road vehicles in a top-down approach. The model?s cross validated R2 was 0.74, and the correlation between the model?s annual averages and the national annual NOx emissions between 1965 and 2011 was 0.75. Information about the road network and population are persistent predictors in many LUR models. The use of available historical data about these predictors to resolve the spatial variability of air pollutants together with complementary national estimates on the change in pollution levels over time enable historical reconstruction of exposures.},

	abstract = {While previous research helped to identify and prioritize the sources of error in air-quality modeling due to anthropogenic emissions and spatial scale effects our knowledge is limited on how these uncertainties affect climate forced air-quality assessments. Using as reference a 10 yr model simulation over the greater Paris (France) area at 4 km resolution and anthropogenic emissions from a 1 km resolution bottom-up inventory, through several tests we estimate the sensitivity of modeled ozone and PM2.5 concentrations to different potentially influential factors with a particular interest over the urban areas. These factors include the model horizontal and vertical resolution, the meteorological input from a climate model and its resolution, the use of a top-down emission inventory, the resolution of the emissions input and the post-processing coefficients used to derive the temporal, vertical and chemical split of emissions. We show that urban ozone displays moderate sensitivity to the resolution of emissions ({\textasciitilde}8\%), the post-processing method (6.5\%) and model resolution ({\textasciitilde}5) while annual PM2.5 levels are particularly sensitive to changes in their primary emissions ({\textasciitilde}32\%) and the resolution of the emission inventory ({\textasciitilde}24\%) while model horizontal and vertical resolution are of little effect.  In addition we use the results of these sensitivities to explain and quantify the discrepancy between a coarse ({\textasciitilde}50 km) and a fine (4 km) resolution simulation over the urban area. We show that the ozone bias of the coarse run (+9 ppb) is reduced by {\textasciitilde}40\% by adopting a higher resolution emission inventory, by 25\% by using a post-processing technique based on the local inventory (same improvement is obtained by increasing model horizontal resolution) and by 10\% by adopting the annual emission totals of the local inventory. The bias on PM2.5 follows a more complex pattern with the positive bias associated to the coarse run (+3.6 μg m3) increasing or decreasing depending on the type of the refinement. We conclude that in the case of fine particles the coarse simulation cannot selectively incorporate local scale features in order to reduce model error.},

Subsequent cluster/nanoparticle growth (GR) showed a clear size dependence, with average values of GR1.35{\textasciitilde}1.39, GR1.39{\textasciitilde}1.46, GR1.46{\textasciitilde}1.70, GR1.70{\textasciitilde}2.39, GR2.39{\textasciitilde}7, and GR7{\textasciitilde}20 being 1.6±1.0, 1.4±2.2, 7.2±7.1, 9.0±11.4, 10.9±9.8, and 11.4±9.7 nm h−1, respectively. Correlation between nucleation rate  (J1.34) and sulfuric acid proxy indicates that nucleation rate J1.34 was proportional to a 0.65±0.28 power of sulfuric acid proxy, indicating that the nucleation of particles can be explained by the activation theory. Correlation between nucleation rate  (J1.34) and gas-phase ammonia suggests that ammonia was associated with NPF events. The calculated sulfuric acid proxy was sufficient to explain the subsequent growth of 1.34–3 nm particles, but its contribution became smaller as the particle size grew. Qualitatively, NPF events in urban Shanghai likely occur on days with low levels of aerosol surface area, meaning the sulfuric acid proxy is only a valid predictor when aerosol surface area is low.},

	abstract = {Numerical model scenarios of future climate depict a global increase in temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, primarily driven by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Aerosol particles also play an important role by altering the Earth's radiation budget and consequently surface temperature. Here, we use the general circulation aerosol model ECHAM5-HAM, coupled to a mixed layer ocean model, to investigate the impacts of future air pollution mitigation strategies in Europe on winter atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. We analyse the extreme case of a maximum feasible end-of-pipe reduction of aerosols in the near future (2030), in combination with increasing GHG concentrations. Our results show a more positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) mean state by 2030, together with a significant eastward shift of the southern centre of action of sea-level pressure (SLP). Moreover, we show a significantly increased blocking frequency over the western Mediterranean.


 By separating the impacts of aerosols and GHGs, our study suggests that future aerosol abatement may be the primary driver of both the eastward shift in the southern SLP centre of action and the increased blocking frequency over the western Mediterranean. These concomitant modifications of the atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Atlantic sector lead to more stagnant weather conditions that favour air pollutant accumulation, especially in the western Mediterranean sector. Changes in atmospheric circulation should therefore be included in future air pollution mitigation assessments. The indicator-based evaluation of atmospheric circulation changes presented in this work will allow an objective first-order assessment of the role of changes in wintertime circulation on future air quality in other climate model simulations.},

The impacts of particle morphology assumptions on hygroscopic predictions are examined. Chamber experiments were conducted at the University of California, Riverside, Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) atmospheric processes lab using two biomass fuel sources: manzanita and chamise. Morphological data was obtained through the use of an aerosol particle mass analyzer (APM), scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Data from these instruments was used to calculate both a dynamic shape factor and a fractal-like dimension for the biomass burning emissions. This data was then used with κ-Köhler theory to adjust the calculated hygroscopicity for experimentally determined morphological characteristics of the aerosol. Laboratory measurement of biomass burning aerosol from two chaparral fuels show that particles are nonspherical with dynamic shape factors greater than 1.15 for aerosol sizes relevant to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation. Accounting for particle morphology can shift the hygroscopicity parameter by 0.15 or more. To our knowledge, this work provides the first laboratory chamber measurements of morphological characteristics for biomass burning cloud condensation nuclei and provides experimental particle shape evidence to support the variation in reported hygroscopicities of the complex aerosol.},

One difficulty arises from the uncertainties in evaluating traffic-related air pollution, especially the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and some particulate matter. Current air quality models are not well suited to evaluate the impact of a short-term traffic change on air quality. Using regional traffic and ambient air quality data from Southern California, we examine the impact of a two-day freeway closure on traffic and several criteria air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5). The results indicate that regional traffic decreased about 14\% on average during the closure. Daily average PM2.5 levels decreased by about 32\%, and daily 8 h maximum ozone levels decreased by about 16\%. However, the daily 1 h maximum NO2 concentration was higher at some sites during the closure. Despite the mixed results with NO2, this study provides empirical evidence to support traffic reduction as an effective strategy to address chronic air pollution problems, especially with regard to ozone, in Southern California.},

In this study, we examine the mixing state of refractory BC (rBC) and other aerosol components in an urban environment (downtown Toronto) utilizing the Aerodyne soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer equipped with a light scattering module (LS-SP-AMS). k-means cluster analysis was used to classify single particle mass spectra into chemically distinct groups. One resultant particle class is dominated by rBC mass spectral signals (C1+ to C5+) while the organic signals fall into a few major particle classes  identified as hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA), and cooking emission organic aerosol (COA). A gradual mixing is observed with small rBC particles only thinly coated by HOA ({\textasciitilde} 28\% by mass on average), while over 90\% of the HOA-rich particles did not contain detectable amounts of rBC. Most of the particles classified into other inorganic and organic particle classes were not significantly associated with rBC. The single particle results also suggest that HOA and COA emitted from anthropogenic sources were likely major contributors to organic-rich particles with vacuum aerodynamic diameter (dva) ranging from {\textasciitilde} 200 to 400 nm. The similar temporal profiles and mass spectral features of the organic classes identified by cluster analysis and the factors from a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the ensemble aerosol data set validate the interpretation of the PMF results.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric concentration measurements are used to adjust the daily to monthly budget of fossil fuel CO2 emissions of the Paris urban area from the prior estimates established by the Airparif local air quality agency. Five atmospheric monitoring sites are available, including one at the top of the Eiffel Tower. The atmospheric inversion is based on a Bayesian approach, and relies on an atmospheric transport model with a spatial resolution of 2 km with boundary conditions from a global coarse grid transport model. The inversion adjusts prior knowledge about the anthropogenic and biogenic CO2 fluxes from the Airparif inventory and an ecosystem model, respectively, with corrections at a temporal resolution of 6 h, while keeping the spatial distribution from the emission inventory. These corrections are based on assumptions regarding the temporal autocorrelation of prior emissions uncertainties within the daily cycle, and from day to day.
 The comparison of the measurements against the atmospheric transport simulation driven by the a priori CO2 surface fluxes shows significant differences upwind of the Paris urban area, which suggests a large and uncertain contribution from distant sources and sinks to the CO2 concentration variability. This contribution advocates that the inversion should aim at minimising model–data misfits in upwind–downwind gradients rather than misfits in mole fractions at individual sites. Another conclusion of the direct model–measurement comparison is that the CO2 variability at the top of the Eiffel Tower is large and poorly represented by the model for most wind speeds and directions. The model's inability to reproduce the CO2 variability at the heart of the city makes such measurements ill-suited for the inversion. This and the need to constrain the budgets for the whole city suggests the assimilation of upwind–downwind mole fraction gradients between sites at the edge of the urban area only.
 The inversion significantly improves the agreement between measured and modelled concentration gradients. Realistic emissions are retrieved for two 30-day periods and suggest a significant overestimate by the AirParif inventory. Similar inversions over longer periods are necessary for a proper evaluation of the optimised CO2 emissions against independent data.},

	abstract = {Despite increasing emission controls, particulate matter (PM) has remained a critical issue for European air quality in recent years. The various sources of PM, both from primary particulate emissions as well as secondary formation from precursor gases, make this a complex problem to tackle. In order to allow for credible predictions of future concentrations under policy assumptions, a modelling approach is needed that considers all chemical processes and spatial dimensions involved, from long-range transport of pollution to local emissions in street canyons. Here we describe a modelling scheme which has been implemented in the GAINS integrated assessment model to assess compliance with PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter {\textless}10 μm) limit values at individual air quality monitoring stations reporting to the AirBase database. The modelling approach relies on a combination of bottom up modelling of emissions, simplified atmospheric chemistry and dispersion calculations, and a traffic increment calculation wherever applicable. At each monitoring station fulfilling a few data coverage criteria, measured concentrations in the base year 2009 are explained to the extent possible and then modelled for the past and future. More than 1850 monitoring stations are covered, including more than 300 traffic stations and 80\% of the stations which exceeded the EU air quality limit values in 2009. As a validation, we compare modelled trends in the period 2000–2008 to observations, which are well reproduced. The modelling scheme is applied here to quantify explicitly source contributions to ambient concentrations at several critical monitoring stations, displaying the differences in spatial origin and chemical composition of urban roadside PM10 across Europe. Furthermore, we analyse the predicted evolution of PM10 concentrations in the European Union until 2030 under different policy scenarios. Significant improvements in ambient PM10 concentrations are expected assuming successful implementation of already agreed legislation; however, these will not be large enough to ensure attainment of PM10 limit values in hot spot locations such as Southern Poland and major European cities. Remaining issues are largely eliminated in a scenario applying the best available emission control technologies to the maximal technically feasible extent.},

Here, using a whole-city heating energy shift opportunity offered by substantial reductions in coal combustion during the heating periods in Urumqi, northwest China, we conducted a four-year study to reveal the impact of replacing coal with natural gas on the mass concentrations and chemical components of PM2.5. We found a significant decline in PM2.5, major soluble ions and metal elements in PM2.5 in January of 2013 and 2014 compared with the same periods in 2012 and 2011, reflecting the positive effects on air quality of using natural gas as a heating fuel throughout the city. This occurred following complete replacement with natural gas for heating energy in October 2012. The weather conditions during winter did not show any significant variation over the four years of the study. Our results indicate that China and other developing nations will benefit greatly from a change in energy source, that is, increasing the contribution of either natural gas or shale gas to total energy consumption with a concomitant reduction in coal consumption.},

	abstract = {From the rural Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) site Hohenpeissenberg in the pre-alpine area of southern Germany, a data set of 24 C2–C8 non-methane hydrocarbons over a period of 7 years was analyzed. Receptor modeling was performed by positive matrix factorization (PMF) and the resulting factors were interpreted with respect to source profiles and photochemical aging. Differing from other studies, no direct source attribution was intended because, due to chemistry along transport, mass conservation from source to receptor is not given. However, at remote sites such as Hohenpeissenberg, the observed patterns of non-methane hydrocarbons can be derived from combinations of factors determined by PMF. A six-factor solution showed high stability and the most plausible results. In addition to a biogenic and a background factor of very stable compounds, four additional anthropogenic factors were resolved that could be divided into two short- and two long-lived patterns from evaporative sources/natural gas leakage and incomplete combustion processes. The volume or mass contribution at the site over the entire period was, in decreasing order, from the following factor categories: background, gas leakage and long-lived evaporative, residential heating and long-lived combustion, short-lived evaporative, short-lived combustion, and biogenic. The importance with respect to reactivity contribution was generally in reverse order, with the biogenic and the short-lived combustion factors contributing most. The seasonality of the factors was analyzed and compared to results of a simple box model using constant emissions and the photochemical decay calculated from the measured annual cycles of OH radicals and ozone. Two of the factors, short-lived combustion and gas leakage/long-lived evaporative, showed winter/summer ratios of about 9 and 7, respectively, as expected from constant source estimations. Contrarily, the short-lived evaporative emissions were about 3 times higher in summer than in winter, while residential heating/long-lived combustion emissions were about 2 times higher in winter than in summer.},

Atmospheric aerosol observations include Neutral cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS) measurements at the research station Melpitz, East Germany between 2008 and 2011. Particle formation events were classified by a new automated method based on the convolution integral of particle number concentration in the diameter range 2–20 nm. To study the relationship with gaseous precursors, a proximity measure was calculated for the sulfuric acid concentration on the basis of a one month intensive measurement campaign in May 2008. A major result was that the number concentration of fresh produced neutral particles correlated significantly with the amount of sulfur dioxide available as a main precursor of sulfuric acid. The condensation sink, a factor potentially inhibiting NPF events, played a subordinate role only. The same held for experimentally determined ammonia concentrations, which also represent a recognised precursor of aerosol particle nucleation. The analysis of meteorological parameters confirmed the absolute need for solar radiation to induce NPF events, and demonstrated the presence of significant turbulence during those events. Due to its tight correlation with solar radiation, however, an independent effect of turbulence for NPF could not be established with certainty. On the basis of observed diurnal cycles of aerosol, gas phase, and meteorological parameters near the ground, we conclude that particle formation is likely to be induced aloft, rather than near the ground.},

	abstract = {New particle formation (NPF) occurs frequently in the global atmosphere. During recent years detailed laboratory experiments together with intensive field observations in different locations have provided insights into the vapours responsible for the initial formation of particles and their subsequent growth. In this regard, the importance of sulphuric acid, stabilizing bases such as ammonia and amines as well as extremely low volatile organics have been proposed. The instrumentation to observe freshly formed aerosol particles has developed to a stage where the instruments can be implemented as part of airborne platforms, such as aircrafts or a Zeppelin-type airship. Flight measurements are technically more demanding and require a greater detail of planning than field studies at the ground level. The high cost of flight hours, limited time available during a single research flight for the measurements and different instrument payloads in Zeppelin airship for various flight missions demanded an analysis tool that would forecast whether or not there is a good chance for a NPF event. Here we present a generalized methodology to derive NPF event probability that was used to optimise flying hours during Zeppelin campaign in Finland during the PEGASOS-Zeppelin Northern mission in 2013. Based on the existing knowledge we derived a method for estimating the nucleation probability that utilizes forecast air mass trajectories, weather forecasts and air quality model predictions. With the forecast tool we were able to predict the occurrence of NPF events for the next day with more than 90\% success rate (10 out of 11 NPF event days correctly predicted).},

To provide insight into factors affecting variability in ambient PM2.5 exposure, distributions of daily PM2.5 exposures for school age children are estimated for four seasons in three climatic zones of the United States using a stochastic microenvironmental exposure model, based on ambient concentration, air exchange rate, penetration factor, deposition rate, census data, meteorological data, and time pattern data. Estimated daily individual exposure varies largely among seasons, regions, and individuals. The mean ratio of ambient exposure to ambient concentration (Ea/Ca) ranges from 0.46 to 0.61 among selected regions and seasons, resulting from differences in air exchange rate. The individual Ea/Ca varies by a factor of 2 to 3 over a 95\% frequency range among simulated children, resulting from variability in children?s time patterns. These patterns are similar among age groups, but vary with the day of the week and outdoor temperature. Variability in exposure is larger between individuals than between groups. The high end ratio of the Ea/Ca, at the 95th percentile of inter-individual variability, is 30\% to 50\% higher than the mean Ea/Ca ratio. Results can be used to intepret and adjust exposure errors in epidemiology and to assist in development of exposure mitigation strategies.},

Future emissions of short-lived gas and aerosol species follow the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) designed in support of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We compare the resulting 2030 land-transport- and shipping-induced aerosol concentrations to the ones obtained for the year 2000 in a previous study with the same model configuration. The simulations suggest that black carbon and aerosol nitrate are the most relevant pollutants from land transport in 2000 and 2030 and their impacts are characterized by very strong regional variations during this time period. Europe and North America experience a decrease in the land-transport-induced particle pollution, although in these regions this sector remains a major source of surface-level pollution in 2030 under all RCPs. In Southeast Asia, however, a significant increase is simulated, but in this region the surface-level pollution is still controlled by other sources than land transport. Shipping-induced air pollution is mostly due to aerosol sulfate and nitrate, which show opposite trends towards 2030. Sulfate is strongly reduced as a consequence of sulfur reduction policies in ship fuels in force since 2010, while nitrate tends to increase due to the excess of ammonia following the reduction in ammonium sulfate. The aerosol-induced climate impact of both sectors is dominated by aerosol-cloud effects and is projected to decrease between 2000 and 2030, nevertheless still contributing a significant radiative forcing to   Earth's radiation budget.},

	abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production in air masses containing either anthropogenic or biogenic (terpene-dominated) emissions is investigated using the explicit gas-phase chemical mechanism generator GECKO-A. Simulations show several-fold increases in SOA mass continuing for multiple days in the urban outflow, even as the initial air parcel is diluted into the regional atmosphere. The SOA mass increase in the forest outflow is more modest ({\textasciitilde}50\%) and of shorter duration (1–2 days). The multiday production in the urban outflow stems from continuing oxidation of gas-phase precursors which persist in equilibrium with the particle phase, and can be attributed to multigenerational reaction products of both aromatics and alkanes, especially those with relatively low carbon numbers (C4–15). In particular we find large contributions from substituted maleic anhydrides and multi-substituted peroxide-bicyclic alkenes. The results show that the predicted production is a robust feature of our model even under changing atmospheric conditions and different vapor pressure schemes, and contradict the notion that SOA undergoes little mass production beyond a short initial formation period. The results imply that anthropogenic aerosol precursors could influence the chemical and radiative characteristics of the atmosphere over an extremely wide region, and that SOA measurements near precursor sources may routinely underestimate this influence.},

	abstract = {Long-term measurements of particle number size distribution (PNSD) produce a very large number of observations and their analysis requires an efficient approach in order to produce results in the least possible time and with maximum accuracy. Clustering techniques are a family of sophisticated methods that have been recently employed to analyse PNSD data; however, very little information is available comparing the performance of different clustering techniques on PNSD data. This study aims to apply several clustering techniques (i.e. K means, PAM, CLARA and SOM) to PNSD data, in order to identify and apply the optimum technique to PNSD data measured at 25 sites across Brisbane, Australia. A new method, based on the Generalised Additive Model (GAM) with a basis of penalised B-splines, was proposed to parameterise the PNSD data and the temporal weight of each cluster was also estimated using the GAM. In addition, each cluster was associated with its possible source based on the results of this parameterisation, together with the characteristics of each cluster. The performances of four clustering techniques were compared using the Dunn index and Silhouette width validation values and the K means technique was found to have the highest performance, with five clusters being the optimum. Therefore, five clusters were found within the data using the K means technique. The diurnal occurrence of each cluster was used together with other air quality parameters, temporal trends and the physical properties of each cluster, in order to attribute each cluster to its source and origin. The five clusters were attributed to three major sources and origins, including regional background particles, photochemically induced nucleated particles and vehicle generated particles. Overall, clustering was found to be an effective technique for attributing each particle size spectrum to its source and the GAM was suitable to parameterise the PNSD data. These two techniques can help researchers immensely in analysing PNSD data for characterisation and source apportionment purposes.},

To reduce uncertainty associated with global emissions of PM2.5, PM10, and TSP, we compiled data with high spatial (0.1° ? 0.1°) and sectorial (77 primary sources) resolutions for 2007 based on a newly released global fuel data product (PKU-FUEL-2007) and an emission factor database. Our estimates for developing countries are higher than those previously reported. Spatial bias associated with large countries could be reduced by using subnational fuel consumption data. Additionally, we looked at temporal trends from 1960 to 2009 at country-scale resolution. Although total emissions are still increasing in developing countries, their intensities in terms of gross domestic production or energy consumption have decreased. PM emitted in developed countries is finer owing to a larger contribution from nonindustrial sources and use of abatement technologies. In contrast, countries like China, with strong industry emissions and limited abatement facilities, emit coarser PM. The health impacts of PM are intensified in hotspots and cities owing to covariance of sources and receptors. Although urbanization reduces the per person emission, overall health impacts related to these emissions are heightened because of aggregation effects.},

	abstract = {The literature on atmospheric particulate matter (PM), or atmospheric aerosol, has increased enormously over the last two decades and amounts now to some 1500–2000 papers per year in the refereed literature. This is in part due to the enormous advances in measurement technologies, which has allowed for an increasingly accurate understanding of the chemical composition and of the physical properties of atmospheric particles and of their processes in the atmosphere. The growing scientific interest in atmospheric aerosol particles is due to their high importance for environmental policy. In fact, particulate matter constitutes one of the most challenging problems both for air quality and climate change policies. In this context, this paper reviews the most recent results within the atmospheric aerosol science, and the policy needs, which have driven much of the increase in monitoring and mechanistic research over the last two decades.
 The synthesis reveals many new processes and developments in the science underpinning climate–aerosol interactions and effects of PM on human health and the environment.  But, while airborne particulate matter is responsible for globally important effects on premature human mortality, we still do not know the relative importance of different chemical components of PM for these effects. Likewise, the magnitude of the overall effects of PM on climate remains highly uncertain. Despite the uncertainty there are many things that could be done to mitigate local and global problems of atmospheric PM. Recent analyses have shown that reducing BC emissions, using known control measures would reduce global warming and delay the time when anthropogenic effects on global temperature would exceed 2 °C. Likewise, cost effective control measures on ammonia, an important agricultural precursor gas for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), would reduce regional eutrophication and PM concentrations in large areas of Europe, China, and the USA. Thus there is much that could be done to reduce effects of atmospheric PM on the climate and the health of the environment and human population.
 A prioritized list of actions to mitigate the full range of effects of PM is currently undeliverable due to shortcomings in knowledge of aerosol science among which the roles of PM in global climate and the relative roles of different PM precursor sources and their response to climate and land use change over the remaining decades of this century are prominent.},

	abstract = {Direct measurements of NOx concentration and flux were made from a tall tower in central London, UK as part of the Clean Air for London (ClearfLo) project. Fast time resolution (10 Hz) NO and NO2 concentrations were measured and combined with fast vertical wind measurements to provide top-down flux estimates using the eddy covariance technique. Measured NOx fluxes were usually positive and ranged from close to zero at night to 2000?8000 ng m?2 s?1 during the day. Peak fluxes were usually observed in the morning, coincident with the maximum traffic flow. Measurements of the NOx flux have been scaled and compared to the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) estimate of NOx emission for the measurement footprint. The measurements are on average 80\% higher than the NAEI emission inventory for all of London. Observations made in westerly airflow (from parts of London where traffic is a smaller fraction of the NOx source) showed a better agreement on average with the inventory. The observations suggest that the emissions inventory is poorest at estimating NOx when traffic is the dominant source, in this case from an easterly direction from the BT Tower. Agreement between the measurements and the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) are better, due to the more explicit treatment of traffic flow by this more detailed inventory. The flux observations support previous tailpipe observations of higher NOx emitted from the London vehicle diesel fleet than is represented in the NAEI or predicted for several EURO emission control technologies. Higher-than-anticipated vehicle NOx is likely responsible for the significant discrepancies that exist in London between observed NOx and long-term NOx projections.},

	abstract = {Aerosol mass scattering efficiency (MSE), used for the scattering coefficient apportionment of aerosol species, is often studied under the condition of low aerosol mass loading in developed countries. Severe pollution episodes with high particle concentration frequently happened in eastern urban China in recent years. Based on synchronous measurement of aerosol physical, chemical, and optical properties at the megacity of Shanghai for two months during autumn 2012, we studied MSE characteristics at high aerosol mass loading. Their relationships with mass concentrations and size distributions were examined. It was found that MSE values from the original US IMPROVE algorithm could not represent the actual aerosol characteristics in eastern China. It results in an underestimation of the measured ambient scattering coefficient by 36\%. MSE values in Shanghai were estimated to be 3.5 ± 0.55 m2/g for ammonia sulfate, 4.3 ± 0.63 m2/g for ammonia nitrate, and 4.5 ± 0.73 m2/g for organic matter, respectively. MSEs for three components increased rapidly with increasing mass concentration in low aerosol mass loading, then kept at a stable level after a threshold mass concentration of 12?24 ?g/m3. During severe pollution episodes, particle growth from an initial peak diameter of 200?300 nm to a peak diameter of 500?600 nm accounts for the rapid increase in MSEs at high aerosol mass loading, that is, particle diameter becomes closer to the wavelength of visible lights. This study provides insights of aerosol scattering properties at high aerosol concentrations and implies the necessity of MSE localization for extinction apportionment, especially for the polluted regions.},

	abstract = {The Puijo aerosol–cloud observation station is a unique measurement site for its location in the mixed region between the boreal forestland and the municipality of Kuopio, Finland. A measurement campaign was carried out at the station during fall 2010. An Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-Tof-AMS) was deployed to characterize the atmospheric submicron aerosols. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to the unified high-resolution mass spectra organic species with NO+ and NO2+ ions to discover the intrinsic relationships between the organic and inorganic species and their daily cycles. On average, the submicron aerosols in this study were dominated by organic and sulfate species, composing 48.2 and 28.7\% of total observed aerosol mass, respectively, with smaller contributions from ammonium (9.3\%), nitrate (4.9\%), chloride (0.8\%) and BC (8.1\%). The sources of these species included the primary emissions originating from the city area, secondary formation from both natural and anthropogenic emissions and regional transport. The PMF analysis succeeded in separating the mixed organic and inorganic spectra into three distinct organic and one inorganic factors. For organic factors, the semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) and low-volatility oxygenated OA (LVOOA) accounted for 54.8 and 36.3\% of total organic masses, respectively, while the hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) accounted for 8.9\% of total organics, with its main source from urban emissions. The inorganic factor is identified as NH4NO3, comprising 6.9\% of the fitted aerosol mass by PMF. Based on the PMF results, the nitrate species were separated into organic and inorganic components, with the organic nitrates contributing one-third of the total nitrate mass. The results highlight both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions as important atmospheric aerosol sources in a forest–urban mixed region.},

	abstract = {Wet deposition is the dominant mechanism for removing black carbon (BC) from the atmosphere and is key in determining its atmospheric lifetime, vertical gradient and global transport. Despite the importance of BC in the climate system, especially in terms of its ability to modulate the radiative energy budget, there are few quantitative case studies of wet removal in ambient environments. We present a case study of BC wet removal by examining aerosol size distributions and BC coating properties sampled in three Canadian boreal biomass burning plumes, one of which passed through a precipitating cloud. This depleted the majority of the plume's BC mass, and the largest and most coated BC-containing particles were found to be preferentially removed, suggesting that nucleation scavenging was likely the dominant mechanism. Calculated single-scattering albedo (SSA) showed little variation, as a large number of non-BC particles were also present in the precipitation-affected plume. The remaining BC cores were smaller than those observed in previous studies of BC in post-precipitation outflow over Asia, possibly due to the thick coating by hydrophilic compounds associated with the Canadian biomass burning particles. This study provides measurements of BC size, mixing state and removal efficiency to constrain model parameterisations of BC wet removal in biomass burning regions, which will help to reduce uncertainty in radiative forcing calculations.},

	abstract = {We use the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry transport model to interpret aircraft measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) in biomass burning outflow taken during the 2011 BORTAS-B campaign over eastern Canada. The model has some skill reproducing the observed variability, with a Spearman's rank correlation rs =  0.65, but has a positive negative bias for observations {\textless}100 ppb and a negative bias for observations {\textgreater} 300 ppb. We find that observed CO variations are largely due to fires over Ontario, as expected, with smaller and less variable contributions from fossil fuel combustion from eastern Asia and NE North America. To help interpret observed variations of CO we develop a Eulerian effective physical age of emissions (A) metric, accounting for mixing and chemical decay, which we apply to pyrogenic emissions of CO. We find that during BORTAS-B the age of emissions intercepted over Halifax, Nova Scotia is typically 4–11 days, and on occasion as young as two days. We show that A is typically 1–5 days older than the associated photochemical ages inferred from co-located measurements of different hydrocarbons. We find that the frequency distribution of differences between the age measures (Δτ) in plumes (defined by CH3CN {\textgreater} 150 ppt) peaks at 3 days. This corresponds to a chemical retardation of 50\%. We find a strong relationship in biomass burning plumes between A and Δτ (r2 = 0.80), which is not present outwith these plumes (r2 = 0.28). We argue that these observed relationships, together with a robust observed relationship between CO and black carbon aerosol during BORTAS-B (r2 {\textgreater} 0.7), form the basis of indirect evidence that aerosols co-emitted with gases during pyrolysis markedly slowed down the plume photochemistry during BORTAS-B with respect to photochemistry at the same latitude and altitude in clear skies.},

	abstract = {In this work, we evaluate ambient ozone trends at urban, suburban, and rural monitoring sites across the United States over a period of decreasing NOx and VOC emissions (1998?2013). We find that decreasing ozone trends generally occur in the summer, in less urbanized areas, and at the upper end of the ozone distribution. Conversely, increasing ozone trends generally occur in the winter, in more urbanized areas, and at the lower end of the ozone distribution. The 95th percentile ozone concentrations decreased at urban, suburban, and rural monitors by 1?2 ppb/yr in the summer and 0.5?1 ppb/yr in the winter. In the summer, there are both increasing and decreasing trends in fifth percentile ozone concentrations of less than 0.5 ppb/yr at urban and suburban monitors, while fifth percentile ozone concentrations at rural monitors decreased by up to 1 ppb/yr. In the winter, fifth percentile ozone concentrations generally increased by 0.1?1 ppb/yr. These results demonstrate the large scale success of U.S. control strategies targeted at decreasing peak ozone concentrations. In addition, they indicate that as anthropogenic NOx emissions have decreased, the ozone distribution has been compressed, leading to less spatial and temporal variability.},

	abstract = {Currently residential wood combustion (RWC) is increasing in Europe because of rising fossil fuel prices but also due to climate change mitigation policies. However, especially in small-scale applications, RWC may cause high emissions of particulate matter (PM).  Recently we have developed a new high-resolution (7 km × 7 km) anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosol emission inventory for Europe. The inventory indicated that about half of the total PM2.5 emission in Europe is carbonaceous aerosol and identified RWC as the largest organic aerosol (OA) source in Europe. The inventory was partly based on national reported PM emissions. Use of this OA inventory as input for two Chemical Transport Models (CTMs), PMCAMx and EMEP MSC-W, revealed major underestimations of OA in winter time, especially for regions dominated by RWC.  Interestingly, this was not universal but appeared to differ by country.


 In the present study we constructed a new bottom-up emission inventory for RWC accounting for the semi-volatile components of the emissions. The new RWC emissions are higher than those in the previous inventory by a factor of 2–3 but with substantial inter-country variation. The new emission inventory served as input for the CTMs and a substantially improved agreement between measured and predicted organic aerosol was found. The new RWC inventory improves the model calculated OA significantly. Comparisons to Scandinavian source apportionment studies also indicate substantial improvements in the modeled wood-burning component of OA. This suggests that primary organic aerosol emission inventories need to be revised to include the semi-volatile OA that is formed almost instantaneously due to cooling of the flue gas or exhaust. Since RWC is a key source of fine PM in Europe, a major revision of the emission estimates as proposed here is likely to influence source-receptor matrices and modelled source apportionment. Since usage of biofuels, such as wood, in small combustion units is a globally significant source, this insight may also dramatically change global estimates of organic aerosol emissions.},

Therefore, a wide variety of policy measures, including both emission abatement technologies and economic adjustment, must be implemented. To support such measures, this study used the production- and consumption-based emissions accounting approaches to simulate the SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and VOC emissions flows among producers and consumers. This study analyzed the emissions and GDP performance of 36 production sectors. The results showed that the equipment, machinery, and devices manufacturing and construction sectors contributed more than 50\% of air pollutant emissions, and most of their products were used for capital formation and export. The service sector had the lowest emission intensities, and its output was mainly consumed by households and the government. In China, the emission intensities of production activities triggered by capital formation and export were approximately twice that of the service sector triggered by final consumption expenditure. This study suggests that China should control air pollution using the following strategies: applying end-of-pipe abatement technologies and using cleaner fuels to further decrease the emission factors associated with rural cooking, electricity generation, and the transportation sector; continuing to limit highly emission-intensive but low value-added exports; developing a plan to reduce construction activities; and increasing the proportion of service GDP in the national economy.},

On-road fleets observed with a remote vehicle exhaust sensor in 2013 at three historical sampling locations in Denver, Los Angeles, and Tulsa showed large reductions in the fleet fractions of 2009 model year vehicles of 40\%, 38\%, and 35\%, respectively, when compared to prerecession 2007 levels with the light-duty truck category suffering the largest percentage declines. The fleet fraction for these ?5 year old vehicles is normally reserved for vehicles more than twice their age. This resulted in a significant increase in the on-road freeway fleet age, which had been relatively stable. The fleet average age increased by two years in Denver and Los Angeles but only by one year in Tulsa, likely due to its faster economic recovery. Using fleet fractions from previous data sets, we estimated age-adjusted mean emissions increases for the 2013 fleet to be 17?29\% higher for carbon monoxide, 9?14\% higher for hydrocarbons, 27?30\% higher for nitric oxide, and 7?16\% higher for ammonia emissions than if historical fleet turnover rates had prevailed.},

BC and PM2.5 levels were measured in real time using a Micro-Aethalometer and a PDR-1500 DataRAM, respectively. Simultaneous samples were also collected on quartz filters for organic and elemental carbon (OC/EC) analysis and on Teflon filters for gravimetric and trace element analysis. In the underground subway stations, mean real time BC concentrations ranged from 5 to 23 ?g/m3, with 1 min average peaks {\textgreater}100 ?g/m3, while real time PM2.5 levels ranged from 35 to 200 ?g/m3. Mean EC levels ranged from 9 to 12.5 ?g/m3. At street level on the same days, the mean BC and PM2.5 concentrations were below 3 and 10 ?g/m3, respectively. This study shows that both BC soot and PM levels in NYC?s subways are considerably higher than ambient urban street levels and that further monitoring and investigation of BC and PM subway exposures are warranted.},

Four types of hypothetical policies (population change, urban sprawl, land-use pattern and network improvement) are designed and the effects of 13 policy scenarios are simulated using data of Dalian City, China. Results reveal that the integrated model system reacts sensitively to policy interventions. The urban sprawl reflected in a changing residential distribution from central to suburban areas is most instrumental from the perspective of pollution alleviation. If the goal is to simultaneously reduce emissions while accommodating mobility, two combinational policy scenarios outperform all others.},

	abstract = {The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) has been providing high-quality retrievals of aerosol optical properties from the surface at worldwide locations for more than a decade. Many sites have continuous and consistent records for more than 10 years, which enables the investigation of long-term trends in aerosol properties at these locations. In this study, we present the results of a trend analysis at selected stations with long data records. In addition to commonly studied parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent (AE), we also focus on inversion products including absorption aerosol optical depth (ABS), single-scattering albedo (SSA) and the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE). Level 2.0 quality assured data are the primary source. However, due to the scarcity of level 2.0 inversion products resulting from the strict AOD quality control threshold, we have also analyzed level 1.5 data, with some quality control screening to provide a reference for global results. Two statistical methods are used to detect and estimate the trend: the Mann–Kendall test associated with Sen's slope and linear least-squares fitting. The results of these statistical tests agree well in terms of the significance of the trend for the majority of the cases. The results indicate that Europe and North America experienced a uniform decrease in AOD, while significant ({\textgreater}90\%) increases in these two parameters are found for North India and the Arabian Peninsula. The AE trends turn out to be different for North America and Europe, with increases for the former and decreases for the latter, suggesting opposite changes in fine/coarse-mode fraction. For level 2.0 inversion parameters, Beijing and Kanpur both experienced an increase in SSA. Beijing also shows a reduction in ABS, while the SSA increase for Kanpur is mainly due the increase in scattering aerosols. Increased absorption and reduced SSA are found at Solar\_Village. At level 1.5, most European and North American sites also show positive SSA and negative ABS trends, although the data are more uncertain. The AAE trends are less spatially coherent due to large uncertainties, except for a robust increase at three sites in West Africa, which suggests a possible reduction in black carbon. Overall, the trends do not exhibit obvious seasonality for the majority of parameters and stations.},

The three measurement sites were intended to allow emissions from the highway to be largely isolated from other sources. By filtering the data and subtracting upwind concentrations, the average roadside increment was calculated to be 1.8, 7.2 and 101.4 μg m−3 for PM10, NO2 and NOx, respectively, relative to a predominantly upwind setback site, and −0.1, 9.4 and 98.5 μg m−3 for PM10, NO2 and NOx, respectively, relative to a downwind setback site. The negative value for PM10 was attributed to local evening heating sources impacting the setback site. On days when peak 24 h PM10 concentrations were observed, the absolute kerbside increment was 2.1 μg m−3. The absolute roadside 24 h average PM10 increment varied diurnally, peaking (on average) at 2.4 μg m−3 during peak traffic hours. The largest observed 24-h average PM10 roadside increment was 6.9 μg m−3 and exceeded 5 μg m−3 on nine occasions. On each of these occasions, the daily mean wind speed was less than 2 m s−1. The diurnally averaged difference in NOx concentrations between the kerbside site and the setback sites clearly resembled the diurnal cycle in traffic volume, and peaked during the morning traffic peak at around 180 μg m−3. Background NOx concentrations were slightly higher in our study compared to a similar study in Las Vegas but absolute roadside concentrations were higher. This may be consistent with higher NOx emission factors in Auckland, but differences in the precise distance of the monitor from the road lanes and differences in meteorology need to be considered.},

Ten years of number size distribution data from two aerosol measurement stations (Vavihill, Sweden and Hyytiälä, Finland) provide aerosol number concentrations in the atmospheric boundary layer. This is combined with cloud satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and weather radar data from the Baltic Sea Experiment. Also, how the meteorological conditions affect the clouds is investigated using reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.
 The cloud droplet effective radius is found to decrease when the aerosol number concentration increases, while the cloud optical thickness does not vary with boundary layer aerosol number concentrations. Furthermore, the aerosol–cloud interaction parameter (ACI), a measure of how the effective radius is influenced by the number concentration of cloud active particles, is found to be somewhere between 0.10 and 0.18 and the magnitude of the ACI is greatest when the number concentration of particles with a diameter larger than 130 nm is used. Lower precipitation intensity in the weather radar images is associated with higher aerosol number concentrations. In addition, at Hyytiälä the particle number concentrations is generally higher for non-precipitating cases than for precipitating cases. The apparent absence of the first indirect effect of aerosols on low-level clouds over land raises questions regarding the magnitude of the indirect aerosol radiative forcing.},

We analyzed lidar data at a wavelength of 532 nm and derived the backscattering ratio and depolarization ratio profiles. During June and July, within the altitude range of 10–15 km, the volcanic aerosols had high depolarization ratios (20–35\%), an indication of non-spherical volcanic ash particles. The time series of the backscattering ratio during continuous observations had three peaks occurring at about 12-day intervals: 26.7 at 11.2 km on 11 June, 18.1 at 12.0 km on 23 June, and 5.3 at 11.1 km on 6 July. The optical depth of the volcanic aerosols was 0.45 on 11 June, when the continuous lidar observation started, 0.31 on 23 June, and 0.12 on 6 July. The depolarization ratio values remained high up to a month after the eruption, and the small wavelength exponent calculated from the backscattering coefficients at 532 nm and 1064 nm suggests that a major constituent of the volcanic aerosols was large, non-spherical particles. The presence of volcanic ash in the stratosphere might affect the error in Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) XCO2 retrieval using the 1.6 μm band. We briefly discuss the influence of the increased aerosols on GOSAT products.},

Few prior studies in a developing country have reported the health impacts of PM2.5 constituents. In this study, we examined the short-term association between PM2.5 constituents and emergency room visits in Shanghai, China. We measured daily concentrations of PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and eight water-soluble ions between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012. We analyzed the data using overdispersed generalized linear Poisson models. During our study period, the mean daily average concentration of PM2.5 in Shanghai was 55 ?g/m3. Major contributors to PM2.5 mass included OC, EC, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. For a 1-day lag, an interquartile range increment in PM2.5 mass (36.47 ?g/m3) corresponded to 0.57\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.13\%, 1.01\%] increase of emergency room visits. In all the three models used, we found significant positive associations of emergency room visits with OC and EC. Our findings suggest that PM2.5 constituents from the combustion of fossil fuel (e.g., OC and EC) may have an appreciable influence on the health impact attributable to PM2.5.},

This state law required progressive reductions (beyond those mandated by federal rules) in pollutant emissions from NC?s coal-fired power plants. Although coal-fired power plants remain NC?s leading SO2 source, a trend analysis shows significant declines in SO2 emissions (?20.3\%/year) and PM2.5 sulfate concentrations (?8.7\%/year) since passage of the act. Emissions reductions were significantly greater in NC than in neighboring states, and emissions and PM2.5 sulfate concentration reductions were highest in NC?s piedmont region, where 9 of the state?s 14 major coal-fired power plants are located. Our risk model estimates that these air quality improvements decreased the risk of premature death attributable to PM2.5 sulfate in NC by about 63\%, resulting in an estimated 1700 (95\% CI: 1500, 1800) deaths prevented in 2012. These findings lend support to recent studies predicting that implementing the proposed federal Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court) could substantially decrease U.S. premature deaths attributable to coal-fired power plant emissions.},

	abstract = {Ultrafine particle size distributions through a deciduous forest canopy indicate that nucleation mode particle concentrations decline with depth into the canopy, such that number concentrations at the bottom of the canopy are an average of 16\% lower than those at the top. However, growth rates of nucleation mode particles (diameters 6–30 nm) are invariant with height within the canopy, which implies that the semi-volatile gases contributing to their growth are comparatively well-mixed through the canopy. Growth rates of nucleation mode particles during a meteorological drought year (2012) were substantially lower than during a meteorologically normal year with high soil water potential (2013). This may reflect suppression of actual biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions by drought and thus a reduction in the production of condensable products during the drought-affected vegetation season. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that growth rates during the normal year exhibit a positive correlation with emissions of BVOC modeled on observed forest composition, leaf area index, temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), but particle growth rates during the drought-affected vegetation season are not correlated with modeled BVOC emissions. These data thus provide indirect evidence that drought stress in forests may reduce BVOC emissions and limit growth of nucleation mode particles to climate-relevant sizes.},

	abstract = {Emissions to air are reported by countries to EMEP. The emissions data are used for country compliance checking with EU emission ceilings and associated emission reductions. The emissions data are also necessary as input for air quality modelling. The quality of these "official" emissions varies across Europe.
 As alternative to these official emissions, a spatially explicit high-resolution emission inventory (7 × 7 km) for UNECE-Europe for all years between 2003 and 2009 for the main air pollutants was made. The primary goal was to supply air quality modellers with the input they need. The inventory was constructed by using the reported emission national totals by sector where the quality is sufficient. The reported data were analysed by sector in detail, and completed with alternative emission estimates as needed. This resulted in a complete emission inventory for all countries.
 For particulate matter, for each source emissions have been split in coarse and fine particulate matter, and further disaggregated to EC, OC, SO4, Na and other minerals using fractions based on the literature. Doing this at the most detailed sectoral level in the database implies that a consistent set was obtained across Europe. This allows better comparisons with observational data which can, through feedback, help to further identify uncertain sources and/or support emission inventory improvements for this highly uncertain pollutant.
 The resulting emission data set was spatially distributed consistently across all countries by using proxy parameters. Point sources were spatially distributed using the specific location of the point source. The spatial distribution for the point sources was made year-specific.
 The TNO-MACC\_II is an update of the TNO-MACC emission data set. Major updates included the time extension towards 2009, use of the latest available reported data (including updates and corrections made until early 2012) and updates in distribution maps.},

	abstract = {Formation and growth of ultrafine particles is crudely represented in chemistry-climate models, contributing to uncertainties in aerosol composition, size distribution, and aerosol effects on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. Measurements of ultrafine particles, their precursor gases, and meteorological parameters were performed in a ponderosa pine forest in the Colorado Front Range in July–August 2011, and were analyzed to study processes leading to small particle burst events (PBEs) which were characterized by an increase in the number concentrations of ultrafine 4–30 nm diameter size particles. These measurements suggest that PBEs were associated with the arrival at the site of anthropogenic pollution plumes midday to early afternoon. During PBEs, number concentrations of 4–30 nm diameter particles typically exceeded 104 cm−3, and these elevated concentrations coincided with increased SO2 and monoterpene concentrations, and led to a factor-of-2 increase in CCN concentrations at 0.5\% supersaturation. The PBEs were simulated using the regional WRF-Chem model, which was extended to account for ultrafine particle sizes starting at 1 nm in diameter, to include an empirical activation nucleation scheme in the planetary boundary layer, and to explicitly simulate the subsequent growth of Aitken particles (10–100 nm) by condensation of organic and inorganic vapors. The updated model reasonably captured measured aerosol number concentrations and size distribution during PBEs, as well as ground-level CCN concentrations. Model results suggest that sulfuric acid originating from anthropogenic SO2 triggered PBEs, and that the condensation of monoterpene oxidation products onto freshly nucleated particles contributes to their growth. The simulated growth rate of {\textasciitilde} 3.4 nm h−1 for 4–40 nm diameter particles was comparable to the measured average value of 2.3 nm h−1. Results also suggest that the presence of PBEs tends to modify the composition of sub-20 nm diameter particles, leading to a higher mass fraction of sulfate aerosols. Sensitivity simulations suggest that the representation of nucleation processes in the model largely influences the predicted number concentrations and thus CCN concentrations. We estimate that nucleation contributes 67\% of surface CCN at 0.5\% supersaturation in this pine forest environment.},

Using US census and highway traffic data we show that traffic can efficiently and accurately be computed from a range-limited, network betweenness type calculation. The model based on travel time costs captures the lognormal distribution of the traffic and attains a high Pearson correlation coefficient (0.75) when compared to real traffic. Due to its principled nature, this method can inform many applications related to human mobility driven flows in spatial networks, ranging from transportation, through urban planning to mitigation of the effects of catastrophic events.},

In particular, we highlight different sources of errors, ranging from incorrect estimate of CO2 to problems related with the definition of cities. We argue here that while data are necessary to build of a new science of cities, they are not enough: they have to go hand in hand with a theoretical understanding of the main processes. This effort of building models whose predictions agree with data is the prerequisite for a science of cities. In the meantime, policy advice are, at best, a shot in the dark.},

Here we present Long path – Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) observations of nocturnal vertical concentration profiles of O3, NO2 and NO3 in the lower atmosphere (33-556 m agl) measured during the CalNex-LA 2010 study. Positive nocturnal vertical gradients of O3 and NO3 and negative gradients of NO2 were observed during the night. Relatively short lifetime of nocturnal NO3 (less than 1000 seconds) and high nighttime steady state N2O5 mixing ratios (up to 2 ppb) indicated active nocturnal chemistry during CalNex. Comparison of modeled and observed altitude resolved NO3 loss frequencies shows that hydrolysis of N2O5 on aerosols was the dominant loss pathway of NO3 and NOx. Based on this argument the nocturnal loss rates of NOx, L(NOx), at different altitudes and averaged over the lowest 550 m of the atmosphere were calculated. The nocturnally averaged L(NOx) ranged between 0.8 - 1.3 ppb hr-1 for the lower atmosphere with the L(NOx) for the first eight days at about 1 ppb hr-1. This number is close to the one previously determined in Houston in 2009 of {\textasciitilde}0.9 ppb hr-1. Comparisons between daytime NOx loss due to the OH + NO2 reaction and nighttime L(NOx) show that during CalNex nocturnal chemistry contributed an average of 38\% to the removal of NOx in a 24 hour period in the lower atmosphere.},

	abstract = {New particle formation (NPF) has been observed frequently at Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL), a high elevation mountain-top observatory in Colorado. Detailed analysis of field measurements taken in March and July of 2012 at SPL reveals significant and interesting differences in NPF during the spring and summer months. Persistent long-lasting NPF occurred on a daily basis in March but was absent in July. Bursts of ultrafine particles did occur frequently in July but such bursts were short-lasting and didn't show any obvious pattern. A global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) coupled with a size-resolved advanced particle microphysics (APM) model are used to interpret in-depth this observed nucleation phenomena. The model captures well the observed persistent daily nucleation events in March and the absence of regional scale NPF in July. Model simulations indicate that aerosol precursors were dominated by H2SO4 gas in March and by low volatile secondary organic gases (LV-SOGs) in July, which is consistent with previous particle composition measurements at SPL. The observed persistent daily NPF in March and the absence of regional-scale nucleation in July at SPL indicate that H2SO4 gas plays a much more critical role in the initial nucleation process, although LV-SOGs dominate particle growth in July. Our analysis suggests that the short-lasting bursts of ultrafine particles observed at SPL in July are likely associated with nucleation in sub-grid power plant plumes where concentrations of H2SO4 rather than LV-SOGs are expected to be higher.},

	abstract = {In this work satellite observations from the NASA's A-Train constellation were used to derive the values of primary emission and regional nucleation proxies over South Africa to estimate the potential for new particle formation. As derived in Kulmala et al. (2011), the satellite based proxies consist of source terms (NO2, SO2 and UV-B radiation), and a sink term describing the pre-existing aerosols. The first goal of this work was to study in detail the use of satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) as a substitute to the in situ based condensation sink (CS). One of the major factors affecting the agreement of CS and AOD was the elevated aerosol layers that increased the value of column integrated AOD but not affected the in situ CS. However, when the AOD in the proxy sink was replaced by an estimate from linear bivariate fit between AOD and CS, the agreement with the actual nucleation mode number concentration improved somewhat. The second goal of the work was to estimate how well the satellite based proxies can predict the potential for new particle formation. For each proxy the highest potential for new particle formation were observed over the Highveld industrial area, where the emissions were high but the sink due to pre-existing aerosols was relatively low. Best agreement between the satellite and in situ based proxies were obtained for NO2/AOD and UV-B/AOD2, whereas proxies including SO2 in the source term had lower correlation. Even though the OMI SO2 boundary layer product showed reasonable spatial pattern and detected the major sources over the study area, some of the known minor point sources were not detected. When defining the satellite proxies only for days when new particle formation event was observed, it was seen that for all the satellite based proxies the event day medians were higher than the entire measurement period median.},

	abstract = {The present study aims at identifying and apportioning fine aerosols to their major sources in Paris (France) – the second most populated "larger urban zone" in Europe – and determining their geographical origins. It is based on the daily chemical composition of PM2.5 examined over 1 year at an urban background site of Paris (Bressi et al., 2013). Positive matrix factorization (EPA PMF3.0) was used to identify and apportion fine aerosols to their sources; bootstrapping was performed to determine the adequate number of PMF factors, and statistics (root mean square error, coefficient of determination, etc.) were examined to better model PM2.5 mass and chemical components. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and conditional probability function (CPF) allowed the geographical origins of the sources to be assessed; special attention was paid to implement suitable weighting functions. Seven factors, namely ammonium sulfate (A.S.)-rich factor, ammonium nitrate (A.N.)-rich factor, heavy oil combustion, road traffic, biomass burning, marine aerosols and metal industry, were identified; a detailed discussion of their chemical characteristics is reported. They contribute 27, 24, 17, 14, 12, 6 and 1\% of PM2.5 mass (14.7 μg m−3) respectively on the annual average; their seasonal variability is discussed. The A.S.- and A.N.-rich factors have undergone mid- or long-range transport from continental Europe; heavy oil combustion mainly stems from northern France and the English Channel, whereas road traffic and biomass burning are primarily locally emitted. Therefore, on average more than half of PM2.5 mass measured in the city of Paris is due to mid- or long-range transport of secondary aerosols stemming from continental Europe, whereas local sources only contribute a quarter of the annual averaged mass. These results imply that fine-aerosol abatement policies conducted at the local scale may not be sufficient to notably reduce PM2.5 levels at urban background sites in Paris, suggesting instead more coordinated strategies amongst neighbouring countries. Similar conclusions might be drawn in other continental urban background sites given the transboundary nature of PM2.5 pollution.},

	abstract = {Hourly measurements of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) were made at Mong Kok, a roadside air quality monitoring station in Hong Kong, for a year, from May 2011 to April 2012. The monthly average EC concentrations were 3.8–4.9 μg C m−3, accounting for 9.2–17.7\% of the PM2.5 mass (21.5–49.7 μg m−3). The EC concentrations showed little seasonal variation and peaked twice daily, coinciding with the traffic rush hours of a day. Strong correlations were found between EC and NOx concentrations, especially during the rush hours in the morning, confirming vehicular emissions as the dominant source of EC at this site. The analysis by means of the minimum OC / EC ratio approach to determine the OC / EC ratio representative of primary vehicular emissions yields a value of 0.5 for (OC / EC)vehicle. By applying the derived (OC / EC)vehicle ratio to the data set, the monthly average vehicle-related OC was estimated to account for 17–64\% of the measured OC throughout the year. Vehicle-related OC was also estimated using receptor modeling of a combined data set of hourly NOx, OC, EC and volatile organic compounds characteristic of different types of vehicular emissions. The OCvehicle estimations by the two different approaches were in good agreement. When both EC and vehicle-derived organic matter (OM) (assuming an OM-to-OC ratio of 1.4) are considered, vehicular carbonaceous aerosols contributed {\textasciitilde} 7.3 μg m−3 to PM2.5, accounting for {\textasciitilde} 20\% of PM2.5 mass (38.3 μg m−3) during winter, when Hong Kong received significant influence of air pollutants transported from outside, and {\textasciitilde} 30\% of PM2.5 mass (28.2 μg m−3) during summertime, when local emission sources were dominant. A reduction of 3.8 μg m−3 in vehicular carbonaceous aerosols was estimated during 07:00–11:00 (i.e., rush hours on weekdays) on Sundays and public holidays. This could mainly be attributed to less on-road public transportation (e.g., diesel-powered buses) in comparison with non-holidays. These multiple lines of evidence confirm local vehicular emissions as an important source of PM2.5 in an urban roadside environment and suggest the importance of vehicular emission control in reducing exposure to PM2.5 in busy roadside environments.},

These changes are discussed in the context of rapid urbanization and the growing imbalance between water supply and demand in Beijing. We observed significant decreases in precipitation amounts from 1950 to 2012, with the annual precipitation decreasing by 32\% at a decadal rate of 28.5 mm. In particular, precipitation decrease is more pronounced in the summer and warm seasons when water use is at its seasonal peak. We further analyzed hourly precipitation data from 43 rain gauges between 1980 and 2012 to examine the spatio-temporal characteristics of both precipitation amount and intensity across six distinct sub-regions in Beijing. No significant spatial variations in precipitation changes were identified, but slightly greater amounts of precipitation were noted in the urban areas (plains) than in the surrounding suburbs (mountains), due to the effect of urbanization and topography. Precipitation intensity has increased substantially, especially at the hourly duration, as evidenced by the more frequent occurrence of extreme storms. The observed decreased water availability and the increase in extreme weather events require more integrated water management, particularly given the expectation of a warmer and more variable climate, the continued rapid growth of the Beijing metropolis, and the intensifying conflict between water supply and demand.},

	abstract = {To quantify the total, direct and indirect impacts of fireworks individually, size-resolved PM samples were collected before, during and after a Chinese folk festival (Chinese New Year) in a megacity in China. Through chemical analysis and morphological characterisation, a strong influence of fireworks on the physicochemical characteristics of PM10 and PM2.5 was observed. The concentrations of many species exhibited an increasing trend during the heavy-firework period, especially for K+, Mg2+ and Cr; the results of the non-sea-salt ions demonstrated an anthropogenic influence on K+ and Mg2+. Then, source apportionment was conducted by receptor models and peak analysis (PA). The total influence of the fireworks was quantified by positive matrix factorisation (PMF), showing that the fireworks contributed higher fractions (23.40\% for PM10 and 29.66\% for PM2.5) during the heavy-firework period than during the light-firework period (4.28\% for PM10 and 7.18\% for PM2.5). The profiles of the total fireworks obtained by two independent methods (PMF and peak analysis) were consistent, with higher abundances of K+, Al, Si, Ca and organic carbon (OC). Finally, the individual contributions of the direct and indirect impacts of fireworks were quantified by chemical mass balance (CMB). The percentage contributions of resuspended dust, biomass combustion and direct fireworks were 36.8 ± 8.37\%, 14.1 ± 2.82\% and 44.4 ± 8.26\%, respectively, for PM10 and 34.9 ± 4.19\%, 16.6 ± 3.05\% and 52.5 ± 9.69\%, respectively, for PM2.5, in terms of the total fireworks. The quantification of the total, direct and indirect impacts of fireworks in the ambient PM gives a original contribution  for understanding the physicochemical characteristics and mechanisms of such high-intensity anthropogenic activities.},

In view of this, filter samples of airborne particulate matter (particle diameter ≤2.5 μm, PM2.5) were collected between May 2008 and April 2010 at two sites (urban background site and suburban site) within the Nairobi metropolitan area. A total of 780 samples were collected and analyzed for particulate mass, black carbon (BC) and 13 trace elements. The average PM2.5 concentration at the urban background site was 21±9.5 μg m−3, whereas the concentration at the suburban site was 13±7.3 μg m−3. The daily PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 25 μg m−3 (the World Health Organization 24 h guideline value) on 29\% of the days at the urban background site and 7\% of the days at the suburban site. At both sites, BC, Fe, S and Cl accounted for approximately 80\% of all detected elements. Positive matrix factorization analysis identified five source factors that contribute to PM2.5 in Nairobi, namely traffic, mineral dust, industry, combustion and a mixed factor (composed of biomass burning, secondary aerosol and aged sea salt). Mineral dust and traffic factors were related to approximately 74\% of PM2.5. The identified source factors exhibited seasonal variation, apart from the traffic factor, which was prominently consistent throughout the sampling period. Weekly variations were observed in all factors, with weekdays having higher concentrations than weekends. The results provide information that can be exploited for policy formulation and mitigation strategies to control air pollution in Sub-Saharan African cities.},

	abstract = {Black carbon aerosols (BC) at a London urban site were characterised in both winter- and summertime 2012 during the Clean Air for London (ClearfLo) project. Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) factors of organic aerosol mass spectra measured by a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) showed traffic-dominant sources in summer but in winter the influence of additional non-traffic sources became more important, mainly from solid fuel sources (SF). Measurements using a single particle soot photometer (SP2, DMT), showed the traffic-dominant BC exhibited an almost uniform BC core size (Dc) distribution with very thin coating thickness throughout the detectable range of Dc. However, the size distribution of Dc (project average mass median Dc  =  149 ± 22 nm in winter, and 120 ± 6 nm in summer) and BC coating thickness varied significantly in winter. A novel methodology was developed to attribute the BC number concentrations and mass abundances from traffic (BCtr) and from SF (BCsf), by using a 2-D histogram of the particle optical properties as a function of BC core size, as measured by the SP2. The BCtr and BCsf showed distinctly different Dc distributions and coating thicknesses, with BCsf displaying larger Dc and larger coating thickness compared to BCtr. BC particles from different sources were also apportioned by applying a multiple linear regression between the total BC mass and each AMS-PMF factor (BC–AMS–PMF method), and also attributed by applying the absorption spectral dependence of carbonaceous aerosols to 7-wavelength Aethalometer measurements (Aethalometer method).
 Air masses that originated from westerly (W), southeasterly (SE), and easterly (E) sectors showed BCsf fractions that ranged from low to high, and whose mass median Dc values were 137 ± 10 nm, 143 ± 11 nm and 169 ± 29 nm, respectively. The corresponding bulk relative coating thickness of BC (coated particle size/BC core – Dp/Dc) for these same sectors was 1.28 ± 0.07, 1.45 ± 0.16 and 1.65 ± 0.19. For W, SE and E air masses, the number fraction of BCsf ranged from 6 ± 2\%  to 11 ± 5\%  to 18 ± 10\%,  respectively, but importantly the larger BC core sizes lead to an increased fraction of BCsf in terms of mass than number (for W, SE and E air masses, the BCsf mass fractions ranged from 16 ± 6\%, 24 ± 10\%  and 39 ± 14\%, respectively). An increased fraction of non-BC particles (particles that did not contain a BC core) was also observed when SF sources were more significant. The BC mass attribution by the SP2 method agreed well with the BC–AMS–PMF multiple linear regression method (BC–AMS–PMF : SP2 ratio = 1.05, r2 = 0.80) over the entire experimental period. Good agreement was found between BCsf attributed with the Aethalometer model and the SP2. However, the assumed absorption Ångström exponent (αwb) had to be changed according to the different air mass sectors to yield the best comparison with the SP2. This could be due to influences of fuel type or burn phase.},

The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) is used to relate each individual AOD retrieval to ground-level PM2.5. Four broad areas showing significant, spatially coherent, annual trends are examined in detail: the Eastern U.S. (?0.39 ± 0.10 ?g m?3 yr?1), the Arabian Peninsula (0.81 ± 0.21 ?g m?3 yr?1), South Asia (0.93 ± 0.22 ?g m?3 yr?1) and East Asia (0.79 ± 0.27 ?g m?3 yr?1). Over the period of dense in situ observation (1999?2012), the linear tendency for the Eastern U.S. (?0.37 ± 0.13 ?g m?3 yr?1) agrees well with that from in situ measurements (?0.38 ± 0.06 ?g m?3 yr?1). A GEOS-Chem simulation reveals that secondary inorganic aerosols largely explain the observed PM2.5 trend over the Eastern U.S., South Asia, and East Asia, while mineral dust largely explains the observed trend over the Arabian Peninsula.},

	abstract = {Understanding the particle number size distributions in diversified atmospheric environments is important in order to design mitigation strategies related to submicron particles and their effects on regional air quality, haze and human health. In this study, we conducted 15 different field measurement campaigns between 2007 and 2011 at 13 individual sites in China, including five urban sites, four regional sites, three coastal/background sites and one ship cruise measurement along eastern coastline of China. Size resolved particles were measured in the 15–600 nm size range. The median particle number concentrations (PNCs) were found to vary in the range of 1.1−2.2 × 104 cm−3 at urban sites, 0.8−1.5 × 104 cm−3 at regional sites, 0.4−0.6 × 104 cm−3 at coastal/background sites, and 0.5 × 104 cm−3 during cruise measurement. Peak diameters at each of these sites varied greatly from 24 to 115 nm. Particles in the 15–25 nm (nucleation mode), 25–100 nm (Aitken mode) and 100–600 nm (accumulation mode) range showed different characteristics at each sites, indicating the features of primary emissions and secondary formation in these diversified atmospheric environments. Diurnal variations show a build-up of accumulation mode particles belt at regional sites, suggesting the contribution of regional secondary aerosol pollution. Frequencies of new particle formation (NPF) events were much higher at urban and regional sites than at coastal sites and during cruise measurement. The average growth rates (GRs) of nucleation mode particles were 8.0–10.9 nm h−1 at urban sites, 7.4–13.6 nm h−1 at regional sites and 2.8–7.5 nm h−1 at coastal sites and during cruise measurement. The high gaseous precursors and strong oxidation at urban and regional sites not only favored the formation of particles, but also accelerated the growth rate of the nucleation mode particles. No significant difference in condensation sink (CS) during NPF days were observed among different site types, suggesting that the NPF events in background areas were more influenced by the pollutant transport. In addition, average contributions of NPF events to potential cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at 0.2\% super-saturation in the afternoon of all sampling days were calculated as 11\% and 6\% at urban sites and regional sites, respectively. On the other hand, NPF events at coastal sites and during cruise measurement had little impact on potential production of CCN. This study provides a large data set of particle size distribution in diversified atmosphere of China, improving our general understanding of emission, secondary formation, new particle formation and corresponding CCN activity of submicron aerosols in Chinese environments.},

In reanalysis of standard films as unknown samples following calibration, the HSPH ED XRF measurements represented good performance: 2\% errors in precision and 4\% errors in accuracy. Replicate analysis of ambient air filters with low PM2.5 levels indicated that S, K, Fe, and Ca showed excellent reproducibility, most other quantifiable elements were below 15\% error, and the elements with larger percent of flagged measurements had less in precision. Results from the interlaboratory comparison demonstrated that most quantifiable elements, except Na and Al, were quite comparable for the three laboratories. Na performance could be validated from the stoichiometry of Na to Cl of indoor PM2.5 filter samples.},

	abstract = {Residential wood combustion is an important source of ambient air pollution, accounting for over 25\% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in Canada. In addition to these ambient contributions, wood smoke pollutants can enter the indoor environment directly when loading or stoking stoves, resulting in a high potential for human exposure. A study of the effectiveness of air cleaners at reducing wood smoke-associated PM2.5 of indoor and outdoor origin was conducted in 31 homes during winter 2009?10. Day 1, the residents? wood burning appliance operated as usual with no air cleaner. Days 2 and 3, the wood burning appliance was not operational and the air cleaner was randomly chosen to operate in ?filtration? or ?placebo filtration? mode. When the air cleaner was operating, total indoor PM2.5 levels were significantly lower than on placebo filtration days (p = 0.0001) resulting in a median reduction of 52\%. There was also a reduction in the median PM2.5 infiltration factor from 0.56 to 0.26 between these 2 days, suggesting the air cleaner was responsible for increased PM2.5 deposition on filtration days. Our findings suggest that the use of an air cleaner reduces exposure to indoor PM2.5 resulting from both indoor and ambient wood smoke sources.},

	abstract = {Air quality during the Commonwealth Games (CWG, held in Delhi in October 2010) is analyzed using a new air quality forecasting system established for the games. The CWG stimulated enhanced efforts to monitor and model air quality in the region. The air quality of Delhi during the CWG had high levels of particles with mean values of PM2.5 and PM10 at the venues of 111 and 238 μg m−3, respectively. Black carbon (BC) accounted for {\textasciitilde} 10\% of the PM2.5 mass. It is shown that BC, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations are well predicted, but with positive biases of {\textasciitilde} 25\%. The diurnal variations are also well captured, with both the observations and the modeled values showing nighttime maxima and daytime minima. A new emissions inventory, developed as part of this air quality forecasting initiative, is evaluated by comparing the observed and predicted species-species correlations (i.e., BC : CO; BC : PM2.5; PM2.5 : PM10). Assuming that the observations at these sites are representative and that all the model errors are associated with the emissions, then the modeled concentrations and slopes can be made consistent by scaling the emissions by 0.6 for NOx, 2 for CO, and 0.7 for BC, PM2.5, and PM10. The emission estimates for particles are remarkably good considering the uncertainty in the estimates due to the diverse spread of activities and technologies that take place in Delhi and the rapid rates of change.
 The contribution of various emission sectors including transportation, power, domestic and industry to surface concentrations are also estimated. Transport, domestic and industrial sectors all make significant contributions to PM levels in Delhi, and the sectoral contributions vary spatially within the city. Ozone levels in Delhi are elevated, with hourly values sometimes exceeding 100 ppb. The continued growth of the transport sector is expected to make ozone pollution a more pressing air pollution problem in Delhi. The sector analysis provides useful inputs into the design of strategies to reduce air pollution levels in Delhi. The contribution for sources outside of Delhi on Delhi air quality range from {\textasciitilde} 25\% for BC and PM to {\textasciitilde} 60\% for day time ozone. The significant contributions from non-Delhi sources indicates that in Delhi (as has been show elsewhere) these strategies will also need a more regional perspective.},

This paper reviews models for assessing intraurban exposure under six classes, including: (i) proximity-based assessments, (ii) statistical interpolation, (iii) land use regression models, (iv) line dispersion models, (v) integrated emission-meteorological models, and (vi) hybrid models combining personal or household exposure monitoring with one of the preceding methods. We enrich this review of the modelling procedures and results with applied examples from Hamilton, Canada. In addition, we qualitatively evaluate the models based on key criteria important to health effects assessment research. Hybrid models appear well suited to overcoming the problem of achieving population representative samples while understanding the role of exposure variation at the individual level. Remote sensing and activity–space analysis will complement refinements in pre-existing methods, and with expected advances, the field of exposure assessment may help to reduce scientific uncertainties that now impede policy intervention aimed at protecting public health.},

Previous assessments of global attributable disease burden have been limited to urban areas or by coarse spatial resolution of concentration estimates. Recent developments in remote sensing, global chemical-transport models, and improvements in coverage of surface measurements facilitate virtually complete spatially resolved global air pollutant concentration estimates. We combined these data to generate global estimates of long-term average ambient concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) and ozone at 0.1° ? 0.1° spatial resolution for 1990 and 2005. In 2005, 89\% of the world?s population lived in areas where the World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline of 10 ?g/m3 PM2.5 (annual average) was exceeded. Globally, 32\% of the population lived in areas exceeding the WHO Level 1 Interim Target of 35 ?g/m3, driven by high proportions in East (76\%) and South (26\%) Asia. The highest seasonal ozone levels were found in North and Latin America, Europe, South and East Asia, and parts of Africa. Between 1990 and 2005 a 6\% increase in global population-weighted PM2.5 and a 1\% decrease in global population-weighted ozone concentrations was apparent, highlighted by increased concentrations in East, South, and Southeast Asia and decreases in North America and Europe. Combined with spatially resolved population distributions, these estimates expand the evaluation of the global health burden associated with outdoor air pollution.},

	abstract = {A long-running effort in environmental communication is daily publication of a report on local air pollution in many American newspapers based on the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI). A 1998 proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to change the PSI prompted a survey experiment with 1,100 adults in Philadelphia, evaluating the proposed change's ability to better inform the populace. The effects of exposure to the old and new versions of the PSI, as well as health cautions and information about groups sensitive to air pollution, were compared with evaluation criteria suggested by Weinstein and Sandman (1993). Sample respondents had strong baseline concerns about air pollution. Descriptors of air quality (e.g., “good; ”“unhealthy”) were difficult to discriminate, particularly in the New format. Concern rose as hypothetical air pollution levels rose, but the New format (as well as PSI versions without health cautions or sensitive-group information) evoked a sharp discontinuity in concern between below- and above-standard pollution levels. Both Old and New formats reduced concern relative to no provision of PSI information at all, but the New format reduced concern significantly more than the Old version. No PSI format did particularly well at increasing knowledge of air pollution or decreasing intentions to be active outdoors during high pollution, contrary to the agency's aim. Although U.S. EPA has since adopted the new proposal as a national “Air Quality Index” requirement, the experiment's results illuminate the strengths and limitations of the new PSI as a means of informing citizens and motivating them to protect themselves.},

	abstract = {Communities have long been concerned about the environmental health and environmental quality of their neighborhoods. Community-based exposure assessments have the potential to be an effective way to address these concerns. The success of such studies depends critically on the effective translation and communication of study results back to the study participants and the community. In this article we describe the communication approach applied as part of the South Baltimore Community Exposure Study. Specifically, in conjunction with collecting measurements, we asked the community to define questions they wanted answered and the way in which they wanted to receive study results. To meet their needs, we applied the risk assessment framework. The approach we developed helped residents interpret exposure assessment measurements and gave them the raw materials to effect change in their community. The risk-based approach to presenting participant and community results provides the means to move beyond traditional reporting of concentration values in three important ways. First, risk takes into consideration toxicity, thereby enabling a dialogue about community health concerns. Second, risk provides a common denominator so that exposure and risk can be compared and priorities identified. Third, exposure and risk can be summed, thereby meeting the community's need for information regarding cumulative exposure. This approach may be a useful model for other researchers conducting exposure assessments in response to community concerns.},

	abstract = {Exposure to gas-phase isocyanic acid (HNCO) has been previously shown to be associated with the development of atherosclerosis, cataracts and rheumatoid arthritis. As such, accurate emission inventories for HNCO are critical for modeling the spatial and temporal distribution of HNCO on a regional and global scale. To date, HNCO emission rates from light duty gasoline vehicles, operated under driving conditions, have not been determined. Here, we present the first measurements of real-time emission factors of isocyanic acid from a fleet of eight light duty gasoline-powered vehicles (LDGVs) tested on a chassis dynamometer using the Unified Driving Cycle (UC) at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Haagen-Smit test facility, all of which were equipped with three-way catalytic converters. HNCO emissions were observed from all vehicles, in contrast to the idealized laboratory measurements. We report the tested fleet averaged HNCO emission factors, which depend strongly on the phase of the drive cycle; ranging from 0.46 ± 0.13 mg kgfuel?1 during engine start to 1.70 ± 1.77 mg kgfuel?1 during hard acceleration after the engine and catalytic converter were warm. The tested eight-car fleet average fuel based HNCO emission factor was 0.91 ± 0.58 mg kgfuel?1, within the range previously estimated for light duty diesel-powered vehicles (0.21?3.96 mg kgfuel?1). Our results suggest that HNCO emissions from LDGVs represent a significant emission source in urban areas that should be accounted for in global and regional models.},

The respondents? quantitative estimate of the GHG contribution appeared to strongly depend on their judgment or knowledge of the cooling effect of aerosols. The phrasing of the IPCC attribution statement in its fourth assessment report (AR4)?providing a lower limit for the isolated GHG contribution?may have led to an underestimation of the GHG influence on recent warming. The phrasing was improved in AR5. We also report on the respondents? views on other factors contributing to global warming; of these Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) was considered the most important.

	abstract = {We conducted long-term network observations using standardized Multi-Axis Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments in Russia and ASia (MADRAS) from 2007 onwards and made the first synthetic data analysis. At seven locations (Cape Hedo, Fukue and Yokosuka in Japan, Hefei in China, Gwangju in Korea, and Tomsk and Zvenigorod in Russia) with different levels of pollution, we obtained 80 927 retrievals of tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (TropoNO2VCD) and aerosol optical depth (AOD). In the technique, the optimal estimation of the TropoNO2VCD and its profile was performed using aerosol information derived from O4 absorbances simultaneously observed at 460–490 nm. This large data set was used to analyze NO2 climatology systematically, including temporal variations from the seasonal to the diurnal scale. The results were compared with Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite observations and global model simulations. Two NO2 retrievals of OMI satellite data (NASA ver. 2.1 and Dutch OMI NO2 (DOMINO) ver. 2.0) generally showed close correlations with those derived from MAX-DOAS observations, but had low biases of up to {\textasciitilde}50\%. The bias was distinct when NO2 was abundantly present near the surface and when the AOD was high, suggesting a possibility of incomplete accounting of NO2 near the surface under relatively high aerosol conditions for the satellite observations. Except for constant biases, the satellite observations showed nearly perfect seasonal agreement with MAX-DOAS observations, suggesting that the analysis of seasonal features of the satellite data were robust. Weekend reduction in the TropoNO2VCD found at Yokosuka and Gwangju was absent at Hefei, implying that the major sources had different weekly variation patterns. While the TropoNO2VCD generally decreased during the midday hours, it increased exceptionally at urban/suburban locations (Yokosuka, Gwangju, and Hefei) during winter. A global chemical transport model, MIROC-ESM-CHEM (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate–Earth System Model–Chemistry), was validated for the first time with respect to background NO2 column densities during summer at Cape Hedo and Fukue in the clean marine atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods with proximal destinations and services encourage walking and decrease car dependence, thereby contributing to more active and healthier communities. Proximity to key destinations and services is an important aspect of the urban design decision making process, particularly in areas adopting a transit-oriented development (TOD) approach to urban planning, whereby densification occurs within walking distance of transit nodes. Modeling destination access within neighborhoods has been limited to circular catchment buffers or more sophisticated network-buffers generated using geoprocessing routines within geographical information systems (GIS). Both circular and network-buffer catchment methods are problematic. Circular catchment models do not account for street networks, thus do not allow exploratory ‘what-if’ scenario modeling; and network-buffering functionality typically exists within proprietary GIS software, which can be costly and requires a high level of expertise to operate.

	abstract = {Atmospheric pollution over South Asia attracts special attention due to its effects on regional climate, the water cycle, and human health. These effects are potentially growing owing to rising trends of anthropogenic aerosol emissions found there. In this study, the spatio-temporal aerosol distributions over South Asia from 7 global models, for the period of 2000–2007, are evaluated systematically against aerosol retrievals of NASA satellite sensors and ground-based measurements. Overall, substantial underestimations of aerosol loading over South Asia are found systematically in 6 out of 7 models. Averaged over the entire South Asia, the annual mean Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is underestimated by a range of 18–45 \% across models compared to MISR, which is the lowest bound among various satellite AOD retrievals (from MISR, SeaWiFS, MODIS Aqua and Terra). In particular at Kanpur located in northern India, AOD is underestimated even more by a factor of 4, and annual mean Aerosol Absorption Optical Depth (AAOD) is underestimated by about a factor of 2 in comparison with AERONET, during the post-monsoon and the wintertime periods (i.e. October–January) when agricultural waste burning and anthropogenic emissions dominate. The largest model underestimation of aerosol loading occurs in the lowest boundary layer (from surface to 2 km) based on the comparisons with aerosol extinction vertical distribution from CALIPSO. The possible causes for the common problems of model aerosol underestimation over south Asia are identified here, which are suggested as the following. During the winter, not only the columnar aerosol loading in models, but also surface concentrations of all aerosol components (sulfate, nitrate, organic aerosol and black carbon) are found lower than observations (ISRO-GBP, ICARB and CALIPSO), indicating that anthropogenic emissions, especially biofuel, are likely underestimated in this season. Nitrate, a major component of aerosols in South Asia, is either not considered in 4 out of 7 models or significantly lower than observations in other 2 models. Surprisingly, the near-surface relative humidity in these models is found significantly lower than observations in the winter, resulting in suppression of the hygroscopic growth of soluble aerosols and formations of sulfate and nitrate, and thereby underestimation of AOD. During the post-monsoon season, the deficiency of agricultural waste burning emissions in GFED2 biomass burning emission inventory, used by the models, partly contributes to the model underestimation of aerosol loading over South Asia in burning seasons.},

Conclusions have been reached that inclement weather does have negative impacts on key traffic parameters. However, due to lack of data, limited work has been implemented in China. In this paper, the impacts of rainfall intensity on urban road traffic flow characteristics are quantified, based on the historical traffic data and weather data in Beijing, capital of China. The reductions of road capacity and operating speed are obtained by statistical estimation for different rainfall intensity categories against clear weather. Then the modified speed-density function and speed-flow function are calibrated at different rainfall levels, from which the reductions of free-flow speed can be calculated. Finally, a generalized continuous speed-flow-rainfall model is developed and calibrated. The validation results show a good accuracy, indicating the new model can be used for urban traffic management under various rainfall intensities.},

	abstract = {Combustion-derived aerosols in the marine boundary layer have been poorly studied, especially in remote environments such as the open Atlantic Ocean. The tropical Atlantic has the potential to contain a high concentration of aerosols, such as black carbon, due to the African emission plume of biomass and agricultural burning products. Atmospheric particulate matter samples across the tropical Atlantic boundary layer were collected in the summer of 2010 during the southern hemispheric dry season when open fire events were frequent in Africa and South America. The highest black carbon concentrations were detected in the Caribbean Sea and within the African plume, with a regional average of 0.6 μg m−3 for both. The lowest average concentrations were measured off the coast of South America at 0.2 to 0.3 μg m−3. Samples were quantified for black carbon using multiple methods to provide insights into the form and stability of the carbonaceous aerosols (i.e., thermally unstable organic carbon, soot like, and charcoal like). Soot-like aerosols composed up to 45\% of the carbonaceous aerosols in the Caribbean Sea to as little as 4\% within the African plume. Charcoal-like aerosols composed up to 29\% of the carbonaceous aerosols over the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea, suggesting that non-soot-like particles could be present in significant concentrations in remote environments. To better apportion concentrations and forms of black carbon, multiple detection methods should be used, particularly in regions impacted by biomass burning emissions.},

	abstract = {To further the understanding and implementation of expert elicitation methods in the evaluation of public policies related to air pollution, the present study?s main goal was to explore the potential strengths and weaknesses of structured expert judgment (SEJ) methodology as a way to derive a C-R function for chronic PM2.5 exposure and premature mortality in Chile. Local experts were classified in two groups according to background and experience: physicians (Group 1) and engineers (Group 2). Experts were required to provide an estimate of the true percent change in nonaccidental mortality resulting from a permanent 1 ?g/m3 reduction in PM2.5 annual average ambient concentration across the entire Chilean territory. Cooke?s Classical Model was used to combine the individual experts? assessments. Experts? mortality estimations varied markedly across groups: while experts in Group 1 delivered higher estimations than those reported in major international cohort studies, estimations from Group 2 were, to varying degrees, anchored to previous studies. Accordingly, combined distributions for each group and all experts were significantly different, due to the high sensitivity of the weighted distribution to experts? performance in calibration variables. Results of this study suggest that, while the use of SEJ has great potential for estimating C-R functions for chronic exposure to PM2.5 and premature mortality and its major sources of uncertainty in countries where no studies are available, its successful implementation is conditioned by a number of factors, which are analyzed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O3) is an environmental pollutant of growing concern, especially in suburban and rural areas where the density of air quality monitoring stations is not high. In this type of areas citizen science strategies can be useful tools for awareness raising, but sensor technologies must be validated before sensor data are communicated to the public. In this work, the performance under field conditions of two custom-made types of ozone sensing devices, based on metal-oxide and electrochemical sensors, was tested. A large array of 132 metal-oxide (Sensortech MICS 2614) and 11 electrochemical (Alphasense) ozone sensors, built into 44 sensing devices, was co-located at reference stations in Italy (4 stations) and Spain (5). Mean R2 between sensor and reference data was 0.88 (0.78–0.96) and 0.89 (0.73–0.96) for Captor (metal-oxide) and Raptor (electrochemical) nodes. The metal-oxide sensors showed an upper limit (approximately 170 μg/m3) implying that these sensors may be useful to communicate mean ozone concentrations but not peak episodes. The uncertainty of the nodes was 10\% between 100 and 150 μg/m3 and 20\% between 150 and 200 μg/m3, for Captors, and 10\% for {\textgreater}100 μg/m3 for Raptors. Operating both types of nodes up to 5 months did not evidence any clear influence of drifts. The use of these sensors in citizen science can be a useful tool for awareness raising. However, significant data processing efforts are required to ensure high data quality, and thus machine learning strategies are advisable. Relative uncertainties should always be reported when communicating ozone concentration data from sensing nodes.},

Selection of both monitor numbers and locations is important for maximizing measured information, while minimizing bias and costs. We developed a two-stage geostatistical-based method using pilot NO2 samples from Lanzhou, China with the goal of improving sample design decision-making, including monitor numbers and spatial pattern. In the first step, we evaluate how additional monitors change prediction precision through minimized kriging variance. This was assessed in a Monte Carlo fashion by adding up to 50 new monitors to our existing sites with assigned concentrations based on conditionally simulated NO2 surfaces. After identifying a number of additional sample sites, a second step evaluates their potential placement using a similar Monte Carlo scheme. Evaluations are based on prediction precision and accuracy. Costs are also considered in the analysis. It was determined that adding 28-locations to the existing Lanzhou NO2 sampling campaign captured 73.5\% of the total kriged variance improvement and resulted in predictions that were on average within 10.9 μg/m3 of measured values, while using 56\% of the potential budget. Additional monitor sites improved kriging variance in a nonlinear fashion. This method development allows for informed sampling design by quantifying prediction improvement (accuracy and precision) against the costs of monitor deployment.},

	abstract = {Noise pollution in urban environments is becoming increasingly common and it has potential to negatively impact people\&rsquo;s health and decrease overall productivity. In order to alleviate these effects, it is important to better quantify noise patterns and levels through data collection and analysis. Wireless sensor networks offer a method for achieving this with a higher level of granularity than traditional handheld devices. In this study, a wireless sensing unit (WSU) was developed that possesses the same functionality as a handheld sound level meter. The WSU is comprised of a microcontroller unit that enables on-board computations, a wireless transceiver that uses Zigbee protocol for data transmission, and an external peripheral board that houses the microphone transducer. The WSU utilizes on-board data processing techniques to monitor noise by computing equivalent continuous sound levels, LeqT, which effectively minimizes data transmission and increases the overall longevity of the node. Strategies are also employed to ensure real-time functionality is maintained on the sensing unit, with a focus on preventing bottlenecks between data acquisition, data processing, and wireless transmission. Four units were deployed in two weeks field validation test and were shown to be capable of monitoring noise for extended periods of time.},

These were used to constrain an air quality model (ADMS-Airport), creating a powerful predictive tool for modelling pollutant concentrations. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the results show that the non-airport component is the dominant fraction (∼75\%) of annual NO2 around the airport and that despite a predicted increase in airport related NO2 with an additional runway, improvements in road traffic fleet emissions are likely to more than offset this increase. This work focusses on London Heathrow Airport, but the sensor network approach we demonstrate has general applicability for a wide range of environmental monitoring studies and air pollution interventions.},

These monitors (AirBeam, HabitatMap) were compared with the widely used direct-reading particulate matter monitors and a gravimetric reference method for PM2.5. Instruments were tested during 20 monitoring sessions that were subdivided in two different seasons to evaluate the performance of sensors across various environmental and meteorological conditions. Measurements were performed at an urban background site in Como, Italy. To evaluate the performance of the instruments, different analyses were conducted on 8-h averaged PM2.5 concentrations for comparison between direct-reading monitors and the gravimetric method, and minute-averaged data for comparison between the direct-reading instruments. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate whether the two measurement methods, when compared, could be considered comparable and/or mutually predictive. Further, Bland-Altman plots were used to determine whether the methods were characterized by specific biases. Finally, the correlations between the error associated with the direct-reading instruments and the meteorological parameters acquired at the sampling point were investigated. Principal results show a moderate degree of agreement between MMs and the reference method and a bias that increased with an increase in PM2.5 concentrations.},

	abstract = {Background
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure may impair fetal growth.
Aims/objectives
Our aim was to assess the effect of portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaner use during pregnancy on fetal growth.
Methods
The Ulaanbaatar Gestation and Air Pollution Research (UGAAR) study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Non-smoking pregnant women recruited at ≤18 weeks gestation were randomized to an intervention (1–2 air cleaners in homes from early pregnancy until childbirth) or control (no air cleaners) group. Participants were not blinded to their intervention status. Demographic, health, and birth outcome data were obtained via questionnaires and clinic records. We used unadjusted linear and logistic regression and time-to-event analysis to evaluate the intervention. Our primary outcome was birth weight. Secondary outcomes were gestational age-adjusted birth weight, birth length, head circumference, gestational age at birth, and small for gestational age. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01741051).
Results
We recruited 540 participants (272 control and 268 intervention) from January 9, 2014 to May 1, 2015. There were 465 live births and 28 losses to follow up. We previously reported a 29\% (95\% CI: 21, 37\%) reduction in indoor PM2.5 concentrations with portable HEPA filter air cleaner use. The median (25th, 75th percentile) birth weights for control and intervention participants were 3450 g (3150, 3800 g) and 3550 g (3200, 3800 g), respectively (p = 0.34). The intervention was not associated with birth weight (18 g; 95\% CI: −84, 120 g), but in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of 429 term births the intervention was associated with an 85 g (95\% CI: 3, 167 g) increase in mean birth weight.
Conclusions
HEPA filter air cleaner use in a high pollution setting was associated with greater birth weight only among babies born at term.},

	abstract = {With the swift growth in commerce and transportation in the modern civilization, much attention has been paid to air quality monitoring, however existing monitoring systems are unable to provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions of the data with cost efficient and real time solutions. In this paper we have investigated the issues, infrastructure, computational complexity, and procedures of designing and implementing real-time air quality monitoring systems. To daze the defects of the existing monitoring systems and to decrease the overall cost, this paper devised a novel approach to implement the air quality monitoring system, employing the edge-computing based Internet-of-Things (IoT). In the proposed method, sensors gather the air quality data in real time and transmit it to the edge computing device that performs necessary processing and analysis. The complete infrastructure \&amp; prototype for evaluation is developed over the Arduino board and IBM Watson IoT platform. Our model is structured in such a way that it reduces the computational burden over sensing nodes (reduced to 70\%) that is battery powered and balanced it with edge computing device that has its local data base and can be powered up directly as it is deployed indoor. Algorithms were employed to avoid temporary errors in low cost sensor, and to manage cross sensitivity problems. Automatic calibration is set up to ensure the accuracy of the sensors reporting, hence achieving data accuracy around 75\&ndash;80\% under different circumstances. In addition, a data transmission strategy is applied to minimize the redundant network traffic and power consumption. Our model acquires a power consumption reduction up to 23\% with a significant low cost. Experimental evaluations were performed under different scenarios to validate the system\&rsquo;s effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is one of the greatest challenges cities are facing today and improving air quality is a pressing need to reduce negative health impacts. In order to efficiently evaluate which are the most appropriate policies to reduce the impact of urban pollution sources (such as road traffic), it is essential to conduct rigorous population exposure assessments. One of the main limitations associated with those studies is the lack of information about population distribution in the city along the day (population dynamics). The pervasive use of mobile devices in our daily lives opens new opportunities to gather large amounts of anonymized and passively collected geolocation data allowing the analysis of population activity and mobility patterns. This study presents a novel methodology to estimate population dynamics from mobile phone data based on a user-centric mobility model approach. The methodology was tested in the city of Madrid (Spain) to evaluate population exposure to NO2. A comparison with traditional census-based methods shows relevant discrepancies at disaggregated levels and highlights the need to incorporate mobility patterns into population exposure assessments.},

	abstract = {City governments all over the world face challenges understanding mobility patterns within dense urban environments at high spatial and temporal resolution. While such measures are important to provide insights into the functional patterns of a city, novel quantitative methods, derived from ubiquitous mobile connectivity, are needed to provide policy-makers with better insights to improve urban management and planning decisions. In this paper, we develop a model that uses large-scale WiFi probe request data to model urban mobility trajectories in dense urban environments. We collect probe request data from a public Wifi network with 54 access points in the Lower Manhattan section of New York City over one week, accounting for more than 30 million observations and over 800,000 unique devices. First, we aggregate unique entries per access point and per hour, demonstrating the potential to use WiFi data to approximate local population counts by type of user. We then use a spatial network analysis to identify edge frequencies and directions of journeys between the network nodes, and apply the results to the road and pedestrian sidewalk network to identify usage intensity levels and trajectories for individual street segments. We demonstrate the significant potential in the use of WiFi probe request data for understanding mobility patterns in cities, while highlighting non-trivial issues in data privacy raised by the growing availability of public WiFi networks.},

Compared with traditional travel data, mobile phone data have many unique features and advantages, which attract scholars in various fields to apply them to travel behaviour research, and a certain amount of progress has been made to date. However, this is only the beginning, and mobile phone data still have great potential that needs to be exploited to further advance human mobility studies.

And yet, the climate change adaptation community has largely overlooked these developments. Here, we examine how “big data” can inform adaptation research and decision-making and outline what’s needed from the adaptation community to maximize this opportunity. We contend that careful application of big data could revolutionize our understanding of how to manage the risks of climate change.

Although a consistent definition is lacking, there is agreement that big data are characterized by the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data streams (2, 3). Climate science has long used large datasets to understand the functioning of the climate system, but the field has been slow to use the passively generated information from digital devices and services that characterize big data (4). In the human dimensions community, big data have rarely been used, aside from studies measuring public opinion on climate change based on social media posts. Despite this neglect, vast amounts of geocoded data on human–environment interactions relevant to adaptation already exist digitally and are being added daily. Such data are not limited to the developed world, with widespread global cell phone coverage and social media use for example (5). Potential adaptation applications of these data are numerous.

Vulnerability research provides essential information for adaptation decision-making by identifying and characterizing who and what are vulnerable to climate change, to what risks, why, and over what timescales. The vulnerability field has expanded considerably over the last decade, although many gaps in understanding vulnerability processes and drivers remain—particularly concerning the real-time nature of human–environment …

	abstract = {Filters can reduce indoor concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5), but their benefits have not been well characterized. This study investigates exposure, health, and cost impacts of high efficiency filters in homes and schools, focusing on the asthma-related outcomes. Reductions in indoor exposures to PM2.5 from outdoor sources with enhanced filters (e.g., MERV 12) are estimated using probabilistic indoor air quality models, and avoided health impacts are quantified using health impact assessment. These methods are applied using data from Detroit, Michigan, an urban region with elevated asthma rates. Replacing inefficient filters with enhanced filters in schools would reduce the PM2.5-attributable asthma burden by 13\% annually, with higher benefits for more efficient filters. Marginal costs average \$63 per classroom or \$32 per child with asthma per year. In homes, using efficient furnace filters or air cleaners yields 11 to 16\% reductions in the asthma burden with an annualized marginal costs of \$151 – 494 per household. Additional benefits include reductions in health risk for adults and lower exposures to other contaminants such as PM from indoor sources. Based on the included health outcomes, efficient filters in schools in particular is a potentially cost-efficient way to reduce the asthma-related health burden for children.},

	abstract = {Wood burning is a common home heating method in many communities in British Columbia and an important source of fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) air pollution. During winter months communities impacted by residential woodsmoke experience high concentrations of PM₂.₅, at levels that have been associated with a wide range of health effects. Characterising levels of woodsmoke within and between communities can support air quality management and reduction of exposures. 
This project tested novel methods to measure the relative levels and spatial variability of residential woodsmoke PM2.5 using fixed and mobile optical instruments. The methods were applied during the winter heating season (January 5th to March 2nd, 2017) across three communities identified to be impacted by residential woodsmoke from fixed-site monitoring data, and three paired communities without routine monitoring.
Continuous monitoring was performed for two weeks at fixed monitoring stations in each monitored community to compare the optical instruments with established methods used to measure PM₂.₅ and woodsmoke. This was combined with nightly mobile monitoring using the same optical instruments, alternating between driving routes around the paired monitored and unmonitored communities to create detailed maps describing woodsmoke levels and variability.
The nephelometer (Bsp) and aethalometer (delta C) tested at the fixed-site were strongly correlated with conventional methods of measuring PM₂.₅ (beta attenuation monitor and filter-based) and woodsmoke (levoglucosan). Comparisons between the instruments during mobile monitoring clearly identified times and areas where woodsmoke was dominating PM₂.₅ concentrations.
Mobile monitoring indicated considerable spatial variation across all communities and identified hotspot areas with consistently elevated concentrations of both PM₂.₅ and woodsmoke. The spatial variance of PM₂.₅ concentrations was significantly greater than the temporal variance during 71\% of the runs, demonstrating the importance of understanding spatial variability when monitoring the air quality impacts of woodsmoke. Strong woodsmoke impacts were found in each community. In general, the unmonitored communities had PM₂.₅ concentrations that were similar to or higher than their partnered monitored communities, despite having smaller sizes and populations.
The development of this approach allows for detailed and cost-effective characterisation of woodsmoke in monitored and unmonitored communities, which could inform source control efforts in many Canadian communities.},

	abstract = {Background
Previous studies reported triggering of acute cardiovascular events by short-term increasedPM2.5 concentrations. From 2007-2013, national and New York state air quality policies and economic influences resulted in reduced concentrations of PM2.5 and other pollutants across the state. We estimated the rate of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with increased PM2.5 concentrations in the previous 1–7 days, and evaluated whether they differed before (2005–2007), during (2008–2013), and after these concentration changes (2014–2016).
Methods
Using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database, we retained all hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of nine cardiovascular disease (CVD) subtypes, for residents living within 15 miles of PM2.5 monitoring sites in Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Queens, Bronx, and Manhattan from 2005-2016 (N = 1,922,918). We used a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to estimate the admission rate for total CVD, and nine specific subtypes, associated with increased PM2.5 concentrations.
Results
Interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM2.5 on the same and previous 6 days were associated with 0.6\%–1.2\% increases in CVD admission rate (2005–2016). There were similar patterns for cardiac arrhythmia, ischemic stroke, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and myocardial infarction (MI). Ambient PM2.5 concentrations and annual total CVD admission rates decreased across the period. However, the excess rate of IHD admissions associated with each IQR increase in PM2.5 in previous 2 days was larger in the after period (2.8\%; 95\%CI = 1.5\%–4.0\%) than in the during (0.6\%; 95\%CI = 0.0\%–1.2\%) or before periods (0.8\%; 95\%CI = 0.2\%–1.3\%), with similar patterns for total CVD and MI, but not other subtypes.
Conclusions
While pollutant concentrations and CVD admission rates decreased after emission changes, the same PM2.5 mass was associated with a higher rate of ischemic heart disease events. Future work should confirm these findings in another population, and investigate whether specific PM components and/or sources trigger IHD events.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PM2.5 and micrometre-sized particles are mainly emitted by residential wood combustion, affecting air pollution in the cities of Chile. Eucalyptus globulus (EG) at 0\% and 25\% wood moisture was burning using a new controlled combustion chamber for emissions (3CE) to determine the emission factors of PM2.5, micrometre-sized particle numbers (0.265 μm to 34.00 μm) and 16 EPA-PAHs plus the retene adsorbed on PM2.5 quartz filters. A method using accelerated solvent extraction, concentration, clean-up and GC–MS is proposed for determining emission factors for 16 EPA-PAHs for the concentration from biomass combustion. Chromatographic conditions and analytical steps were optimized in terms of linearity, selectivity, limits of detection and quantification, precision and accuracy. The recovery obtained from urban dust SRM 1649A (NIST reference material) analyses was between 63\% (benzo[b]fluoranthene) and 102\% (benzo[k]fluoranthene). In this investigation, it was shown that increasing the wood moisture in combustion tests decreased combustion efficiency (93\% to 49\%) and increased the emission factors of total PAHs (5215.47 ng g−1 to 7644.48 ng g−1), the gravimetric PM2.5 (2.01 g kg−1 to 22.90 g kg−1) and the total number of measured micrometre-sized particles (3.15 × 1012 particles kg−1 to 1.33 × 1013 particles kg−1) due to incomplete combustion. The PM2.5 emission rates (ERs) were estimated using EG at 0\% WM (2.39 g −1 to 3.15 g h−1) and 25\% WM (27.32 g h−1 to 35.77 g h−1) for three regions of Chile. In almost all regions, the Chilean emission regulations were exceeded for PM2.5 from wood combustion in the heater (stove with thermal power ≤8 kW and emission limit of 2.5 g h−1). Finally, when using wet wood for residential combustion, the amount of PAHs on the PM2.5 increased, presenting a potential hazard to population health. Therefore, improvements are necessary in the current regulation of PM emissions.},

	abstract = {Santiago (33.5°S, 70.5°W), the capital of Chile, is frequently affected by extreme air pollution events during wintertime deteriorating air quality (AQ) and thus affecting the health of its population. Intense residential heating and on-road transport emissions combined with poor circulation and vertical mixing are the main factors responsible for these events. A modelling system composed of a chemistry-transport model (CHIMERE) and a meteorological model (WRF) was implemented to assess the AQ impacts of residential and transportation sources in the Santiago basin. A two-week period of July 2015 with various days with poor AQ was simulated focusing on the impact on AQ with respect to fully inhalable particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Three emission scenarios, within the range of targeted reductions of the decontamination plan of Santiago, were tested; namely 50\% reduction of residential emission, 50\% reduction of transport emissions and the combination of both. An additional scenario decreasing transport emissions in 10\% was carried out to examine whether a linear dependence of surface concentrations on changes in emissions exists. The system was validated against surface and vertically resolved meteorological measurements. The model reproduces the daily surface concentration variability from the AQ monitoring network of Santiago. However, the model not fully captures the emissions variations inferred from the observations which may be due to missing sources such as resuspension of dust. Results show that, during the period studied, although both residential and transportation sources contribute to observed AQ levels in Santiago, reducing transport emissions is more effective in terms of reducing the number of days with pollution events than decreasing residential combustion. This difference in impact is largely due to the spatial distribution of the emission sources. While most of the residential combustion is emitted in the outskirts of the city, most of the transport emissions occur within the city, where most of the stations from AQ monitoring network of Santiago are located. As can be expected, the largest improvement of AQ in Santiago is achieved by the combined reduction of emissions in both sectors. Sensitivity analysis with 10\% reduction in transport emissions reveals a linear behavior between emissions and concentrations for NOX and approximate linear behavior for PM2.5. The absence of secondary aerosols formation and dust resuspension in the current simulation could explain this deviation from linearity for fine particles. Nevertheless, it suggests that the results can be used for mitigation policies with emissions reductions below the 50\% used in this study.},

	abstract = {Organic aerosol (OA) is a major component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in urban environments. We performed in-motion ambient sampling from a mobile platform with an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to investigate the spatial variability and sources of OA concentrations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a midsize, largely postindustrial American city. To characterize the relative importance of cooking and traffic sources, we sampled in some of the most populated areas (∼18 km2) in and around Pittsburgh during afternoon rush hour and evening mealtime, including congested highways, major local roads, areas with high densities of restaurants, and urban background locations. We found greatly elevated OA concentrations (10s of μg m–3) in the vicinity of numerous individual restaurants and commercial districts containing multiple restaurants. The AMS mass spectral information indicates that majority of the high concentration plumes (71\%) were from cooking sources. Areas containing both busy roads and restaurants had systematically higher OA concentrations than areas with only busy roads and urban background locations. Elevated OA concentrations were measured hundreds of meters downwind of some restaurants, indicating that these sources can influence air quality on neighborhood scales. Approximately 20\% of the population (∼250 000 people) in the Pittsburgh area lives within 200 m of a restaurant; therefore, restaurant emissions are potentially an important source of outdoor PM exposures for this large population.},

	abstract = {The environmental benefits from electric cars (ECs) depend on several aspects, including source of electric energy generation, type of EC, and associated air pollutant emissions. For example, EC fleet (full ECs, no hybrid ECs) do not emit gaseous pollutants, but still emit a certain amount of particulate matter. Full ECs emit particulate matter through their non-exhaust sources, which includes wear and tear of tires and brakes. Often, non-exhaust particulate emissions are neglected by decision makers and environmental agencies. This may impact the development of effective environmental and public health policies. In this paper, we assess particulate matter emissions (PM10 and PM2.5) considering two EC adoption scenarios within a major metropolitan area in Canada-Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). In addition, we estimate potential human health risk for each scenario. Our results show that non-exhaust particle emissions (brake and tire) consist of mostly PM10. We estimate that for Scenarios 1 (10\% of EC penetration) and 2 (100\% of EC penetration), the respective emission reductions (exhaust + brake + tire) will be 37 and 94\% for PM2.5, and 4 and 85\% for PM10. Furthermore, compared to baseline, 10 and 100\% EC adoption scenarios will reduce PM-related annual deaths by 37 and 87\%, respectively. However, even considering the aggressive 100\% EC adoption scenario, we will still have considerable PM10 and PM2.5 non-tailpipe emissions, i.e., {\textasciitilde} 743 and 189 kg day−1, respectively. If 100\% EC adoption scenario is realized, each individual in the GTHA will inhale about 0.80 × 10−3 ppm day−1 (where 1 ppm indicates that 1 g inhaled per each ton emitted). Our results underline the importance of non-tailpipe emissions. Therefore, we suggest that environmental agencies must develop policies to account for and limit non-exhaust PM emissions, and the automotive industry must focus on reducing non-exhaust emissions from ECs.},

Winter-time traffic tunnel measurements acquired using dual scanning mobility particle sizers (SMPS) over the size range 3–500 nm form the key input for the analysis. Size-resolved mass emission factors were calculated assuming a nanoparticle aggregate model. The ultrafine particle ({\textless}30 nm) emissions of diesel vehicles significantly dropped from 2002 to 2014. In the 2014 study, a thermodenuder (TD) was deployed together with the SMPS to measure emissions of non-volatile particles. After evaporation at 250 °C inside the TD, the median diameter of the number-size distribution shifted from 16 nm to ∼7 nm. The total particle number decreases significantly (69\%) after evaporating inside the TD, indicating that vehicle emitted particles may be largely externally mixed and that a large fraction of these particles may be purely composed of volatile components. Based on the SMPS-TD measurements, we report a size-resolved volatile-to-non-volatile-component-ratio for vehicle emitted particles. It shows that smaller particles (10–60 nm) emitted by vehicles are dominantly (over 75\%) composed of volatile components. We also apportioned the size-resolved particles and non-volatile particle mass and number emission factors for both gasoline and diesel vehicles. Diesel vehicles emitted significantly more ultrafine particles and non-volatile particles than gasoline vehicles.},

	abstract = {Airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a pollutant that is found in all urban environments. PM2.5 is predominantly generated by traffic and domestic fuel combustion and has significant negative health impacts. The ever-growing urban population spends most of their time in indoor environments where it is exposed to PM2.5 that is brought in from the outdoor environment by ventilation airflow. Several studies show this inflow of outdoor PM2.5, combined with internal sources (e.g. indoor combustion, particle re-suspension) can lead to an I/O ratio above one: indoor air quality is lower than outdoors. The most common approach to limit ventilation inflow of PM2.5 is the use of mechanical ventilation systems with cloth filters that can significantly increase ventilation fan energy consumption. Decreasing exposure to PM2.5 is challenging, requiring a thorough understanding of PM2.5’s origin and the interaction between buildings and their surrounding environment. This review of the impact of PM2.5 in indoor urban environments summarizes existing research in this area, specifically, the main PM2.5 sources and sinks in outdoor and indoor urban environments, the PM2.5 exposure limits that are currently applicable throughout the world, the main socio-economic impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and the most promising solutions to minimize indoor exposure.},

	abstract = {In fire-prone areas such as southern Australia and parts of the United States, prescribed burning is a common fire management tool to reduce fuel load for wildfire suppression purposes. The burns are typically undertaken during calm and stable conditions when the burn extent and duration can be carefully controlled. This often coincides with poor atmospheric ventilation, leading to a build-up of smoke which can impact air quality and human health. The low intensity of these burns also means that the plume is less buoyant and the main impact on local populations is due to emissions during the slow and prolonged smouldering combustion of heavy fuels. This study presents emissions measurements of PM2.5 at prescribed burns in eucalypt forests of southern Australia using a smoke collection method suitable for both flaming combustion of fine fuels and residual smouldering combustion of heavy fuels and logs. The median PM2.5 emission factors (EFs) measured were 16.9 g kg-1 fuel during flaming combustion and 38.8 g kg-1 fuel during smouldering combustion. The correlation between PM2.5 EFs and modified combustion efficiency (MCE) highlights two distinct trends at low MCE, attributed to the distinct combustion processes of glowing char combustion and pyrolysis. Hence two distinct relationships were developed that best fitted the measurements and that can be used to extrapolate measured EFs to a wider range of fuel and burning conditions. The results from this study addressed a gap in our knowledge of particle emissions during burns in eucalypt forests under different burning conditions and help to better forecast and manage air quality impacts from prescribed burns on nearby communities.},

The Household Air Pollution Tool model was employed to estimate health benefits attributable to various fuel use scenarios using user-derived and publicly available inputs, including the Global Burden of Disease data presented by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. This study assessed personal exposure for four fuel user groups: LPG-only, LPG and charcoal, charcoal only, and wood use alone or in combination with any other fuel. Ambient PM2.5 concentrations were also assessed during the study period. The wood user group demonstrated significantly higher PM2.5 exposure than the other three user groups, which all had average PM2.5 personal exposure similar to the average ambient PM2.5 concentration. The results of the exposure assessment imply that ambient particulate matter may drive the majority of PM2.5 exposure in peri-urban LPG and charcoal using households in Accra and therefore for the majority of homes in Accra ({\textasciitilde}80\% are non-wood users in urban Ghana), reductions in PM2.5 exposure and associated health gains may require reducing ambient PM. From a study by Zhou et al., in Accra biomass burning accounted for 39–62\% of total PM2.5 mass in the kitchen in different neighborhoods. Road dust and vehicle emissions comprised 12–33\% of PM2.5 mass. This means that even if direct PM emissions are low from LPG and charcoal burning homes, homes using wood fuel to meet their household energy needs contribute to ambient PM, which influences the PM2.5 exposure of their non-wood using neighbors.},

However, they require pollutant concentrations at multiple locations along with land-use variables. Often, monitoring is performed over short durations using mobile monitoring with research-grade instruments. Low-cost PM monitors provide an alternative approach that increases the spatial and temporal resolution of the air quality data. LUR models were developed to predict hourly PM concentrations across a metropolitan area using PM concentrations measured simultaneously at multiple locations with low-cost monitors. Monitors were placed at 23 sites during the 2015/16 heating season. Monitors were externally calibrated using co-located measurements including a reference instrument (GRIMM particle spectrometer). LUR models for each hour of the day and weekdays/weekend days were developed using the deletion/substitution/addition algorithm. Coefficients of determination for hourly PM predictions ranged from 0.66 and 0.76 (average 0.7). The hourly-resolved LUR model results will be used in epidemiological studies to examine if and how quickly, increases in ambient PM concentrations trigger adverse health events by reducing the exposure misclassification that arises from using less time resolved exposure estimates.},

In order to address this challenge and avoid increasing monitoring costs, attention is now being redirected towards using low-cost sensing units and an opportunistic citizen sensing. This paper proposes a comparative study of using various air quality monitoring devices such as: high-reliable fixed air pollution stations, fixed smaller passive tubes and smart mobile sensors, tested through field measurements and citizen sensing in an econeighbourhood from Lorraine, France. The air quality evaluation is done through two experimenting protocols. The first protocol involves the installation of passive tubes for monitoring the NO2 concentration levels inside the eco-neighbourhood, placed in strategic locations highly affected by traffic circulation. The second experimentation protocol aimed at monitoring the NO2 levels registered at the human level by citizens travelling daily inside the neighbourhood and carrying with them the smart pollution sensor. The findings revealed that the mobile sensors carried at the human level (approximatively at 1.5 meters altitude) detected higher NO2 concentrations which would sometimes be between three to five times higher than the passive-static monitoring tubes (placed at 3 meters altitude).},

In the CLCFC-SPF, the wavelength selectively coupling from the SPF to the cholesteric liquid crystal film (CLCF) results in the resonant dips in the transmitted spectrum. It is found that the pitch of the CLCF increases with VOC gas concentration, which reduces the refractive index (RI) of CLCF and results in a blue shift of the resonant dips. By tracing the blue shift of the resonant dips, the VOC gas sensing characteristic of the CLCFC-SPF were investigated experimentally. For tetrahydrofuran, acetone and methanol gas, the sensitivities of the CLCFC-SPF are respectively measured as 7.08 nm⋅L/mmol, 3.46 nm⋅L/mmol, 0.52 nm⋅L/mmol. Using the wavelength selectively coupling theory, gaseous-optic coefficient of the CLC can also be obtained and were measured in the experiment as 6.6 × 10-4 RIU⋅L/mmol, 2.9 × 10-4 RIU⋅L/mmol, 0.6 × 10-4 RIU⋅L/mmol, respectively, for tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and methanol gas. Additionally, the experimental results also show that both the sensitivity of CLCFC-SPF and the gaseous-optic coefficient of the CLCF increase with the molar mass of the VOC gas.

Birth cohort studies are the best available study design to answer this question, but the evidence from such studies has not been synthesized to date. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published birth cohort studies to understand the association between early childhood TRAP exposure, and subsequent asthma, allergies and sensitization. Increased longitudinal childhood exposure to PM2.5 and black carbon was associated with increasing risk of subsequent asthma in childhood (PM2.5: OR 1.14, 95\%CI 1.00 to 1.30 per 2 μg/m3 and black carbon: OR 1.20, 95\%CI 1.05 to 1.38 per 1 × 10−5 m−1). Also, early childhood exposure to TRAP was associated with development of asthma across childhood up to 12 years of age. The magnitude of these associations increased with age, and the pattern was prominent for PM2.5. Increasing exposure to PM2.5 was associated with sensitization to both aero- and food allergens. There was some evidence that TRAP was associated with eczema and hay fever. In summary, exposure to TRAP was related to asthma and allergic diseases. However, the substantial variability across studies warrants long-term birth cohort studies with regular repeated follow-ups to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to approximately 800,000 premature deaths each year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, many studies show that the relationship is deeper and far more complicated than originally thought. PM is a portion of air pollution that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid droplets containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. PM is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of air pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. PM is thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data demonstrating PM's effect on the cardiovascular system are strong. Populations subjected to long-term exposure to PM have a significantly higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for PM's effects on cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also exacerbated by exposure to PM. PM causes respiratory morbidity and mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows PM causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use, decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and increased mortality. PM exposure has been shown to have a small but significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between PM and human disease, and that removal from a PM-rich environment decreases the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the PM effect on susceptible populations, the preponderance of data shows that PM exposure causes a small but significant increase in human morbidity and mortality. Most sources agree on certain “common sense” recommendations, although there are lonely limited data to support them. Indoor PM exposure can be reduced by the usage of air conditioning and particulate filters, decreasing indoor combustion for heating and cooking, and smoking cessation. Susceptible populations, such as the elderly or asthmatics, may benefit from limiting their outdoor activity during peak traffic periods or poor air quality days. These simple changes may benefit individual patients in both short-term symptomatic control and long-term cardiovascular and respiratory complications.},

	abstract = {Around 50\% of people, almost all in developing countries, rely on coal and biomass in the form of wood, dung and crop residues for domestic energy. These materials are typically burnt in simple stoves with very incomplete combustion. Consequently, women and young children are exposed to high levels of indoor air pollution every day. There is consistent evidence that indoor air pollution increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and of acute respiratory infections in childhood, the most important cause of death among children under 5 years of age in developing countries. Evidence also exists of associations with low birth weight, increased infant and perinatal mortality, pulmonary tuberculosis, nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer, cataract, and, specifically in respect of the use of coal, with lung cancer. Conflicting evidence exists with regard to asthma. All studies are observational and very few have measured exposure directly, while a substantial proportion have not dealt with confounding. As a result, risk estimates are poorly quantified and may be biased. Exposure to indoor air pollution may be responsible for nearly 2 million excess deaths in developing countries and for some 4\% of the global burden of disease. Indoor air pollution is a major global public health threat requiring greatly increased efforts in the areas of research and policy-making. Research on its health effects should be strengthened, particularly in relation to tuberculosis and acute lower respiratory infections. A more systematic approach to the development and evaluation of interventions is desirable, with clearer recognition of the interrelationships between poverty and dependence on polluting fuels.},

	abstract = {The sentiment that woodsmoke, being a natural substance, must be benign to humans is still sometimes heard. It is now well established, however, that wood-burning stoves and fireplaces as well as wildland and agricultural fires emit significant quantities of known health-damaging pollutants, including several carcinogenic compounds. Two of the principal gaseous pollutants in woodsmoke, CO and NOx, add to the atmospheric levels of these regulated gases emitted by other combustion sources. Health impacts of exposures to these gases and some of the other woodsmoke constituents (e.g., benzene) are well characterized in thousands of publications. As these gases are indistinguishable no matter where they come from, there is no urgent need to examine their particular health implications in woodsmoke. With this as the backdrop, this review approaches the issue of why woodsmoke may be a special case requiring separate health evaluation through two questions. The first question we address is whether woodsmoke should be regulated and/or managed separately, even though some of its separate constituents are already regulated in many jurisdictions. The second question we address is whether woodsmoke particles pose different levels of risk than other ambient particles of similar size. To address these two key questions, we examine several topics: the chemical and physical nature of woodsmoke; the exposures and epidemiology of smoke from wildland fires and agricultural burning, and related controlled human laboratory exposures to biomass smoke; the epidemiology of outdoor and indoor woodsmoke exposures from residential woodburning in developed countries; and the toxicology of woodsmoke, based on animal exposures and laboratory tests. In addition, a short summary of the exposures and health effects of biomass smoke in developing countries is provided as an additional line of evidence. In the concluding section, we return to the two key issues above to summarize (1) what is currently known about the health effects of inhaled woodsmoke at exposure levels experienced in developed countries, and (2) whether there exists sufficient reason to believe that woodsmoke particles are sufficiently different to warrant separate treatment from other regulated particles. In addition, we provide recommendations for additional woodsmoke research.},

	abstract = {Background
Health departments and urban planners have growing needs for high resolution data on urban air pollution, to quantify existing health burdens at the neighborhood scale, to identify and prioritize exposure reduction strategies for pollution hot-spots, to track progress in achieving air quality-related health improvement goals, and to assess health co-benefits of longer-term carbon mitigation strategies. To-date, however, few tools have been available to inform these high priority urban health objectives. As part of the NASA Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team (HAQAST) project, this study was designed to field test a unique low-cost sensor for measuring long-term concentrations of PM2.5 mass and composition at sites impacted by road traffic in three cities: Boston, New York, and San Francisco.
Methods
Starting in August 2017, we deployed University of North Carolina (UNC) passive samplers at 2–3 sites each in Boston, NYC and San Francisco. Sites were chosen due to availability of co-located sampling for PM2.5 using conventional, high-cost sensors, and proximity to major roadways. Each sampler had a filter placed under a fine mesh screen of 1.5 cm in diameter; particles settled gravitationally and by diffusion. We tested two sampling periods: 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Particles accumulated on the filter for as long as the sampler was left open to the air. Samplers were sent to a laboratory for analysis by electron microscopy and analyzed data was returned to us. We also obtained publically available data from high cost regulatory monitors for the sites in Boston, and compared daily averages.
Results
We deployed samplers on schedule and found that strong winds, particularly near highways, would occasionally disrupt the horizontal orientation of the sampler or cause the sampler to blow away; this was solved by using more sturdy mounting brackets. Initial laboratory results indicate that the 12-week sampling period provides optimal filter loadings. Sampling in 2016 and 2017 at two sites in Boston tell us that the near-road site presents higher PM2.5 annual concentrations by 0.5 to 1 ug/m3. Quantitative analyses comparing the low-cost sensor data with co-located standard devices will be carried out in the coming months as data accumulate.
Conclusions
Preliminary qualitative results suggest that the novel low-cost UNC sensor can be easily deployed at the community scale, with the potential to achieve broader engagement of the civil society and develop tools to enable our stakeholders to carry out health-based air quality assessments at relevant community scales.},

	abstract = {Wildfires generate plumes of smoke which release toxic pollutants into the atmosphere and affect the surrounding air quality significantly. Smoke contains carbonous particles that influence the regional climate patterns. Wildfires sometimes generate thick smoke layers that cause poor visibility and accidents. Generally smoke tends to disperse in form of layers in the atmosphere. Aircraft measurements are performed to understand the dynamics of smoke plumes. However, these measurements involve cost and enormous amount of exercise. Significant amount of information is required for understanding the dissipation of smoke from wildfires. Occasionally, smoke generated from wildfires cross political boundaries and influence chemical composition of atmosphere. Recently, at a unit of Department of Space (DOS) located near Tirupati, a laser radar system was developed indigenously for remote sensing smoke layers in the atmosphere. The developed laser radar system uses a novel multi-angle method to track the smoke layers in the atmosphere. The LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) system uses visible wavelength for probing smoke layers. The system was operated during dry season to remote sense smoke layers produced by wildfires that occurred in the nearby reserve forest. During the observations, the LIDAR system was found suitable for tracking smoke plume boundaries, its top height, dispersion and change of its intensity with time.},

	abstract = {Addressing the worsening urban air quality situation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is proving increasingly difficult owing to paucity of data on air pollution levels and also, lack of local evidence on the magnitude of the associated health effects. There is therefore the urgent need to expand air quality monitoring (AQM) networks in SSA to enable the conduct of high quality epidemiologic studies to help inform policies aimed at addressing air pollution and the associated health effects. In this commentary, I explore the prospects that the proliferation of low-cost sensors in recent times holds for air pollution epidemiologic research in SSA. This commentary is timely because most SSA governments do not see investments in air pollution control that requires assembling a network of sophisticated and prohibitively expensive instrumentation for AQM as necessary for improving and protecting public health. I conclude that, in a region that is bereft of air pollution data, the growing influx of low-cost sensors represents an excellent opportunity for bridging the data gap to inform air pollution control policies and regulations for public health protection. However, it is essential that only the most promising sensor technologies that performs creditably well in the harsh environmental conditions of the region are promoted.},

	abstract = {The remarkable advances in sensing and communication technologies have introduced increasingly low-cost, smart and portable sensors that can be embedded everywhere and play an important role in environmental sensing applications such as air quality monitoring. These user-friendly wireless sensor platforms enable assessment of human exposure to air pollution through observations at high spatial resolution in near-realtime, thus providing new opportunities to simultaneously enhance existing monitoring systems, as well as engage citizens in active environmental monitoring. However, data quality from such platforms is a concern since sensing hardware of such devices is generally characterized by a reduced accuracy, precision, and reliability. Achieving good data quality and maintaining error free measurements during the whole system lifetime is challenging. Over time, sensors become subject to several sources of unknown and uncontrollable faulty data which comprise the accuracy of the measurements and yield observations far from the expected values. This paper investigates calibration of low-cost air quality sensors in a real sensor network deployment. The approach leverages on the availability of sensor arrays in a wireless node to estimate parameters that minimize the calibration error using fusion of data from multiple sensors. The obtained results were encouraging and show the effectiveness of the approach compared to a single sensor calibration.},

	abstract = {Objectives There is highly suggestive evidence for an effect of air pollution exposure on dementia-related outcomes, but evidence is not yet present to clearly pinpoint which pollutants are the probable causal agents. The aims of this study was to assess the longitudinal association between exposures of fine ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) from residential wood burning, and vehicle exhaust, with dementia. Method We used data from the Betula study, a longitudinal study of dementia in Umeå, Northern Sweden. The study size was 1 806 and the participants were followed from study entry (1993–1995) to 2010. Modelled levels of source-specific fine particulate matter at the residential address were combined with information on wood stoves or wood boilers, and with validated data on dementia diagnosis and individual-level characteristics from the Betula study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) and their 95\% CIs for dementia incidence (vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease), adjusted for individual-level characteristics. Results The emission of PM2.5 from local residential wood burning was associated with dementia incidence with a hazard ratio of 1.55 for a 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.00–2.41, p-value 0.05). Study participants with an address in an area with the highest quartile of PM2.5 from residential wood burning and who also had a wood-burning stove were more likely to develop dementia than those in the lower three quartiles without a wood-burning stove with hazard ratios of 1.74 (CI: 1.10–2.75, p-value 0.018). Particulate matter from traffic exhaust seemed to be associated with dementia incidence with hazard ratios of 1.66, (CI: 1.16–2.39), p-value 0.006, and 1.41 (CI: 0.97–2.23), p-value 0.07, in the third and fourth quartiles, respectively. Conclusions If the associations we observed are causal, then air pollution from residential wood burning, and air pollution from traffic, might be independent important risk factors for dementia.},

	abstract = {Background Asthma is a common childhood disease that leads to many missed days of school and parents’ work. There are multiple environmental contributors to asthma symptoms and understanding the potential factors inside children’s homes is crucial. Methods This is a dual cohort study measuring household particulate matter (PM2.5), behaviors, and factors that influence air quality and asthma symptoms in the urban homes of children (ages 6–10) with asthma; one cohort had cigarette smoke exposure in the home (n = 13) and the other did not (n = 22). Exposure data included measurements every 5 minutes for a month. Results In the entire study population, a large contributor to elevations in indoor PM2.5 above 35 μg/m3 was not using the stove hood when cooking (8.5\% higher, CI 3.1–13.9\%, p{\textless}0.005). Median PM values during cooking times were 0.88 μg/m3 higher than those during non-cooking times (95\% CI 0.33–1.42). Mean monthly household PM2.5 level was significantly related to the presence of a cigarette smoker in the home (10.1 μg/m3 higher, 95\% CI 5.2–15.1, p{\textless}0.001) when controlling for use of the stove hood and proximity to major roadway. There was a trend toward increased odds of persistent asthma with increases in average monthly PM2.5 (OR 1.1, 95\% CI 0.97–1.3, p = 0.16). Conclusions Consideration of only outdoor PM2.5 may obscure potentially modifiable risks for asthma symptoms. Specifically, this preliminary study suggests that cooking behaviors may contribute to the burden of PM2.5 in the homes of children with asthma and thus to asthma symptoms.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions within urban environments are characterized by spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability that present challenges for measuring urban greenhouse gases and air pollutants. To address these challenges, we mounted instruments on public transit light-rail train cars that traverse the metropolitan Salt Lake Valley (SLV) in Utah, USA to observe the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric species including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Utilizing electrified light-rail public transit as an observational platform enables real-time measurements with low operating costs while avoiding self-contamination from vehicle exhaust. We examine temporal averages and case studies of each species that reveal gradients, intermittent point sources, seasonal and diel changes, and complex relationships resulting from emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorological conditions. CO2 and NO2 are related through the combustion of fossil fuel and we observed a broad spatial gradient across the city as well distinct plumes at traffic intersections and, for NO2, a large plume adjacent to a locomotive rail yard. Distributions of O3 were strongly correlated with NO2 due to atmospheric photochemical and titration processes. Episodes of high PM2.5 had distinct spatial patterns depending on meteorological conditions during wintertime persistent cold-air pool episodes. The spatial pattern of CH4 was characterized by distinct plumes associated with industrial and commercial facilities, some of which followed temporal patterns indicative of daytime working hours; other plumes were persistent throughout the whole day, suggestive of leak-related fugitive emissions. The ongoing multi-year record of spatial and temporal air quality observations provides a valuable data set for future air quality exposure studies. Our results suggest pollution and greenhouse gas emission monitoring and exposure assessment could be greatly enhanced by deploying instruments on public transit systems in urban centers worldwide.},

	abstract = {Environmental conditions and air quality monitoring have become crucial today due to the undeniable changes of the climate and accelerated urbanization. To efficiently monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and the levels of pollutants, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air, and to collect data covering vast geographical areas, the development of cheap energy-autonomous sensors for large scale deployment and fine-grained data acquisition is required. Rapid advances in electronics and communication technologies along with the emergence of paradigms such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have led to the development of low-cost sensor devices that can operate unattended for long periods of time and communicate using wired or wireless connections through the Internet. We investigate the energy efficiency of an environmental monitoring system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons that operate in the IoT environment. The beacons developed measure the temperature, the relative humidity, the light intensity, and the CO2 and VOC levels in the air. Based on our analysis we have developed efficient sleep scheduling algorithms that allow the sensor nodes developed to operate autonomously without requiring the replacement of the power supply. The experimental results show that low-power sensors communicating using BLE technology can operate autonomously (from the energy perspective) in applications that monitor the environment or the air quality in indoor or outdoor settings.},

This result has been achieved by introducing some modifications to the sensor's operating directions as specified by the manufacturer. These modifications mainly concern: a different geometry for the sampled air flow (to enable the detection of single particles), a more accurate processing of the output signal (to maximize the signal/noise ratio), and a simple yet an accurate metrological calibration, which exploits the statistical properties of commonly available polydispersed particulate (talc powder), instead of needing monodispersed material (expensive and difficult to employ). The experimental results show that, under the proper conditions, the calibrated instrument is indeed able to measure the optical size of the detected particles and therefore to determine the particle size distribution (i.e., the granulometric analysis) of the sampled particulate.},

	abstract = {Objectives We sought to investigate the relationship between air quality and heart failure (HF) incidence and rehospitalisation to elucidate whether there is a threshold in this relationship and whether this relationship differs for HF incidence and rehospitalisation.
Methods This retrospective observational study was performed in an Australian state-wide setting, where air pollution is mainly associated with wood-burning for winter heating. Data included all 1246 patients with a first-ever HF hospitalisation and their 3011 subsequent all-cause readmissions during 2009–2012. Daily particulate matter {\textless}2.5 µm (PM2.5), temperature, relative humidity and influenza infection were recorded. Poisson regression was used, with adjustment for time trend, public and school holiday and day of week.
Results Tasmania has excellent air quality (median PM2.5=2.9 µg/m3 (IQR: 1.8–6.0)). Greater HF incidences and readmissions occurred in winter than in other seasons (p{\textless}0.001). PM2.5 was detrimentally associated with HF incidence (risk ratio (RR)=1.29 (1.15–1.42)) and weakly so with readmission (RR=1.07 (1.02–1.17)), with 1 day time lag. In multivariable analyses, PM2.5 significantly predicted HF incidence (RR=1.12 (1.01–1.24)) but not readmission (RR=0.96 (0.89–1.04)). HF incidence was similarly low when PM {\textless}4 µg/m3 and only started to rise when PM2.5≥4 µg/m3. Stratified analyses showed that PM2.5 was associated with readmissions among patients not taking beta-blockers but not among those taking beta-blockers (pinteraction=0.011).
Conclusions PM2.5 predicted HF incidence, independent of other environmental factors. A possible threshold of PM2.5=4 µg/m3 is far below the daily Australian national standard of 25 µg/m3. Our data suggest that beta-blockers might play a role in preventing adverse association between air pollution and patients with HF.},

One area identified as requiring more attention is that of deployment logistics, that is, how to select deployment sites and how to strategically place sensors at these sites. Given that sensors are often placed at homes and businesses, ideal placement is not always possible. Considerations such as convenience, access, aesthetics, and safety are also important. To explore this issue, we placed multiple sensor systems at an existing field site allowing us to examine both neighborhood-level and building-level variability during a concurrent period for CO2 (a primary pollutant) and O3 (a secondary pollutant). In line with previous studies, we found that local and transported emissions as well as thermal differences in sensor systems drive variability, particularly for high-time resolution data. While this level of variability is unlikely to affect data on larger averaging scales, this variability could impact analysis if the user is interested in high-time resolution or examining local sources. However, with thoughtful placement and thorough documentation, high-time resolution data at the neighborhood level has the potential to provide us with entirely new information on local air quality trends and emissions.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab?to?field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long?term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

	abstract = {The increased availability and improved quality of new sensing technologies have catalyzed a growing body of research to evaluate and leverage these tools in order to quantify and describe urban environments. Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R2 = 0.36–0.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R2 = 0.68–0.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors.},

	abstract = {Any activity involving burning things/fuels and mixing substances that cause chemical reactions may release toxic gases in the process and some activities like construction, mining, transportation, etc. produce large amounts of dust which has the potential to cause air pollution. As generation of toxic gases from industries, vehicles and other sourcesis tremendously increasing day by day, it becomes difficult to control the hazardous gases from polluting the pure air. Air pollution not only brings serious damage to human health but also causes negative effects to natural environments. The air pollution occurs due to contamination of air with Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and many other harmful pollutants. This pollutant causes serious damage to environment. It also has hazardous effects on human health. Carbon monoxide reduces oxygen carrying capacity of the body's organs and tissues which may lead to cardiovascular disease. Carbon monoxide causes visual impairment, reduced manual dexterity, reduced work capacity, poor learning ability. So it becomes more and more important to monitor and control air pollution. It will become easy to control it by monitoring the concentration air pollutant parameters in air. Using laboratory analysis, conventional air automatic monitoring system has relatively complex equipment technology, large bulk, unstable operation and high cost.},

The aim of the LIFE PHOTOSCALING Project (LPP) is to assess the effectiveness of different photocatalytic pavements in reducing NO2 pollution. The objective of this preliminary study is to determine how well low cost AQmesh sensors can accurately enough measure NO2 concentrations to be able to determine the effects of using photocatalytic pavements. Data was collected from AQmesh sensors that were installed in two Air Quality Stations in order to monitor NO2 under traffic and urban background conditions. The NO2 measurements were unreliable, resulting in an unsatisfactory level of accuracy. A two-step calibration method was devised in order to overcome this limitation. This method consisted of supervised statistical machine learning regression algorithms. A first Multivariate Linear Regression provided a new explanatory variable that contained valuable information about the error. This variable was fed into more sophisticated equations, such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. The various models were evaluated by calculating statistics of errors and relative expanded uncertainties, and through Taylor Diagrams. After a careful calibration, AQmesh sensors met the Air Quality Directive’s standards of accuracy at high concentrations of NO2. However, we found that each individual sensor behaves differently and thus, each unit requires the development and application of a specific calibration model.},

In light of this, the Spearman correlation analysis and cluster analysis are utilized to reveal the similar behavior in Shanghai PM2.5 monitoring network respectively. They coincidentally demonstrate that there exists redundant equipment in monitoring network. Then based on it, the linear method of stepwise regression and the nonlinear method of support vector regression are applied to predict PM2.5 concentration at target station in term of the values at surrounding stations. Both of them show good performance and they are recognized to be practicable to estimate the values measured by redundant equipment. Obviously, these findings give rise to the possibility to remove some equipment in monitoring network. Hence, in order to remove it reasonably, two removing criteria for redundant equipment are suggested finally. It makes use of the similarity in air quality monitoring network and guarantees that the missed values caused by removed equipment can be replaced successfully through prediction, which are advantage for monitoring network advisors to make informed decisions as to whether a redundant equipment must be removed or relocated.},

This study employs a measurement tool, called the U-Pod, constructed at the University of Colorado Boulder, to investigate spatial and temporal variability of O3 in a 200 km2 area of Riverside County near Los Angeles, California. This tool contains low-cost sensors to collect ambient data at non-permanent locations. The U-Pods were calibrated using a pre-deployment field calibration technique; all the U-Pods were collocated with regulatory monitors. After collocation, the U-Pods were deployed in the area mentioned. A subset of pods was deployed at two local regulatory air quality monitoring stations providing validation for the collocation calibration method. Field validation of sensor O3 measurements to minute-resolution reference observations resulted in R2 and root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 0.95–0.97 and 4.4–5.9 ppbv, respectively. Using the deployment data, ozone concentrations were observed to vary on this small spatial scale. In the analysis based on hourly binned data, the median R2 values between all possible U-Pod pairs varied from 0.52 to 0.86 for ozone during the deployment. The medians of absolute differences were calculated between all possible pod pairs, 21 pairs total. The median values of those median absolute differences for each hour of the day varied between 2.2 and 9.3 ppbv for the ozone deployment. Since median differences between U-Pod concentrations during deployment are larger than the respective root mean square error values, we can conclude that there is spatial variability in this criteria pollutant across the study area. This is important because it means that citizens may be exposed to more, or less, ozone than they would assume based on current regulatory monitoring.},

There is evidence that air pollution increases the risk of asthma hospitalisations and healthcare utilisation, but the effects on day-to-day asthma control are not fully understood.


Objective

We undertook a prospective single-centre panel study to test the hypothesis that personal air pollution exposure is associated with asthma symptoms, lung function and airway inflammation.


Methods

Thirty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of asthma were provided with a personal air pollution monitor (Cairclip NO2/O3) which was kept on or around their person throughout the 12-week follow-up period. Ambient levels of NO2 and particulate matter were modelled based upon satellite imaging data. Directly measured ozone, NO2 and particulate matter levels were obtained from a monitoring station in central Leicester. Participants made daily electronic records of asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and exhaled nitric oxide. Spirometry and asthma symptom questionnaires were completed at fortnightly study visits. Data were analysed using linear mixed effects models and cross-correlation.


Results

Cairclip exposure data were of good quality with clear evidence of diurnal variability and a missing data rate of approximately 20\%. We were unable to detect consistent relationships between personal air pollution exposure and clinical outcomes in the group as a whole. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, total oxidant exposure was associated with increased daytime symptoms in women but not men.


Conclusions and clinical relevance

We did not find compelling evidence that air pollution exposure impacts on day-to-day clinical control in an unselected asthma population, but further studies are required in larger populations with higher exposure levels. Women may be more susceptible than men to the effects of air pollution, an observation which requires confirmation in future studies.

	abstract = {Particulate and gaseous emissions of two medium-sized district heating facilities (400 kW, fueled with miscanthus, and 1.5 MW, fueled with wood chips) were characterized for different operational conditions, and compared to previously obtained results for household wood and pellet stoves. SO2 and NOx emission factors (reported in mg MJFuel−1) were found to not only depend on fuel sulfur/nitrogen content, but also on combustion appliance type and efficiency. Emission factors of SO2, NOx, and PM (particulate matter) increased with increasing load. Particle chemical composition did not primarily depend on operational conditions, but varied mostly with combustion appliances, fuel types, and flue gas cleaning technologies. Black carbon content was decreasing with increasing combustion efficiency; chloride content was strongly enhanced when burning miscanthus. Flue gas cleaning using an electrostatic precipitator caused strong reduction not only in total PM, but also in the fraction of refractory and semi-refractory material within emitted PM1. For the impact of facilities on their surroundings (immissions) not only their total emissions are decisive, but also their stack heights. In immission measurements downwind of the two facilities, a plume could only be observed for the 400 kW facility with low (11 m) stack height (1.5 MW facility: 30 m), and measured immissions agreed reasonably well with predicted ones. The impact of these immissions is non-negligible: at a distance of 50 m from the facility, apart from CO2, also plume contributions of NOx, ultrafine particles, PM1, PM10, poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, and sulfate were detected, with enhancements above background values of 2–130\%.},

	abstract = {In many urban areas the population is exposed to
elevated levels of air pollution. However, real-time air quality
is usually only measured at few locations. These measurements
provide a general picture of the state of the air, but
they are unable to monitor local differences. New low-cost
sensor technology is available for several years now, and has
the potential to extend official monitoring networks signifi-
cantly even though the current generation of sensors suffer
from various technical issues.
Citizen science experiments based on these sensors must
be designed carefully to avoid generation of data which is of
poor or even useless quality. This study explores the added
value of the 2016 Urban AirQ campaign, which focused
on measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. Sixteen low-cost air quality sensor devices were
built and distributed among volunteers living close to roads
with high traffic volume for a 2-month measurement period.
Each electrochemical sensor was calibrated in-field next to
an air monitoring station during an 8-day period, resulting in
R
2
ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. When temperature and relative
humidity are included in a multilinear regression approach,
the NO2 accuracy is improved significantly, with R
2
ranging
from 0.6 to 0.9. Recalibration after the campaign is crucial,
as all sensors show a significant signal drift in the 2-month
measurement period. The measurement series between the
calibration periods can be corrected for after the measurement
period by taking a weighted average of the calibration
coefficients.
Validation against an independent air monitoring station
shows good agreement. Using our approach, the standard deviation
of a typical sensor device for NO2 measurements was
found to be 7 µgm−3
, provided that temperatures are below
30 ◦C. Stronger ozone titration on street sides causes an underestimation
of NO2 concentrations, which 75 \% of the time
is less than 2.3 µgm−3
.
Our findings show that citizen science campaigns using
low-cost sensors based on the current generations of electrochemical
NO2 sensors may provide useful complementary
data on local air quality in an urban setting, provided that
experiments are properly set up and the data are carefully
analysed},

So far, however, they have not been used for direct assessment of personal exposure to air pollution. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the first, and the only available, mobile phone—BROAD Life—equipped with air pollution sensors (PM2.5 and VOC), to answer the question whether this technology is a viable option in the quest of reducing the burden of disease to air pollution. We tested its performance, applicability and suitability for the purpose by subjecting it to varied concentrations of different types of aerosol particles (cigarette smoke, petrol exhaust and concrete dust) and formaldehyde under controlled laboratory conditions, as well as to ambient particles during field measurements. Six reference instruments were used in the study: AEROTRAK Optical Particle Counter (OPC model number 9306), DustTrak, Aerodynamic Particle Counter (APS), Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) and Formaldehyde Analyser. Overall, we found that the phone’s response was linear at higher particle number concentrations in the chamber, above 5 and 10 μg m-3, for combustion and concrete dust particles, respectively, and for higher formaldehyde concentrations, making it potentially suitable for applications in polluted environments. At lower ambient concentrations of particles around 10 ug m-3 and 20 μg m-3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, the phone’s response was below its noise level, suggesting that it is not suitable for ambient monitoring under relatively clean urban conditions. This mobile phone has a number of limitations that may hinder its use in personal exposure and for continuous monitoring. Despite these limitations, it may be used for comparative assessments, for example when comparing outcomes of intervention measures or local impacts of air pollution sources. It should be kept in mind, however, that a mobile phone measuring air quality alone cannot as such 'reduce the burden of disease to air pollution, as knowing ambient concentrations is only one of the building block in this quest. As long as individuals cannot avoid exposure e.g. in urban areas, knowing concentrations is not sufficient to reduce potential adverse effects. Yet, there are many situations and microenvironments, which individuals could avoid knowing the concentrations and also being aware of the risk caused by exposure to them. This includes for example to proximity to vehicle emissions, either for social purposes (e.g. street cafes) or exercising (e.g. walking or jogging along busy roads)or indoor environments affected by combustion emissions (smoking, candle burning, open fire).},

	abstract = {Exposure to household air pollution is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. However, due to the lack of validated low-cost monitors with long-lasting batteries in indoor environments, most epidemiologic studies use self-reported data or short-term household air pollution assessments as proxies of long-term exposure. We evaluated the performance of three low-cost monitors measuring fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) in a wood-combustion experiment conducted in one household of Spain for 5 days (including the co-location of 2 units of HAPEX and 3 units of TZOA-R for PM2.5 and 3 units of EL-USB-CO for CO; a total of 40 unit-days). We used Spearman correlation (ρ) and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) to assess accuracy of low-cost monitors versus equivalent research-grade devices. We also conducted a field study in India for 1 week (including HAPEX in 3 households and EL-USB-CO in 4 households; a total of 49 unit-days). Correlation and agreement at 5-min were moderate-high for one unit of HAPEX (ρ = 0.73 / CCC = 0.59), for one unit of TZOA-R (ρ = 0.89 / CCC = 0.62) and for three units of EL-USB-CO (ρ = 0.82–0.89 / CCC = 0.66–0.91) in Spain, although the failure or malfunction rate among low-cost units was high in both settings (60\% of unit-days in Spain and 43\% in India). Low-cost monitors tested here are not yet ready to replace more established exposure assessment methods in long-term household air pollution epidemiologic studies. More field validation is needed to assess evolving sensors and monitors with application to health studies.},

To study the inner-neighborhood variability of such particles, we measured the number concentration of fine particles for six months in five locations across an urban residential neighborhood, using a network of compact optical particles counters. This setup enabled us to apply a wavelet analysis to study the variability of the particle number concentration at different time-scales. Analysis of the particle number concentration (PNC) time series revealed common patterns that could be attributed to regional background PNC, and to neighborhood-scale processes with typical time-scales \&gt;4 h. Spatially heterogeneous (i.e. local) features in the observed PNC, evident at smaller scales with typical time scales \&lt;4 h, had no clear long-time pattern. The variability across the neighborhood materialized mainly in the upper percentiles of the PNC distribution rather than in its central measures, revealing a prominent right tail (skewness \&gt;1). Wavelet resolved temporal scales of the PNC and wind measurements showed similar spatial patterns, with the correlation between the wavelet coefficients of the two signals mirroring typical temporal and spatial dispersion characteristics at the corresponding scales.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.},

In the southwestern United States, unhealthy air quality has been observed in some homes that use solid fuels as a primary source of heat on the Navajo Nation. In order to better understand how home heating fuel choice can influence indoor air quality in this region, we used recently developed low-cost electrochemical sensors to measure carbon monoxide (CO) air mole fractions continuously inside and outside 41 homes in two communities on the Navajo Nation. Using low-cost sensors in this study, which don't require extensive training to operate, enabled collaboration with local Diné College students and faculty in the planning and implementation of home deployments. Households used natural gas, propane, pellets, wood, and/or coal for heating. We developed quantification methods that included uncertainty estimation for Alphasense CO-B4 sensors, for measurements both inside and outside homes. CO concentrations elevated above background were observed in homes in each heating fuel group, but the highest hourly concentrations were observed in wood and coal burning homes, some of which exceeded World Health Organization Guidelines on both an hourly and eight-hourly basis. In order to probe the many factors that can influence indoor pollutant concentrations, we developed and implemented methods that employ CO emission and decay time periods observed in homes during everyday activities to estimate air exchange rates as well as CO emission rates on the basis of a given well-mixed volume of air. The air quality measurement tools and methods demonstrated in this study can be readily extended to indoor air quality studies in other communities around the world to inform how home heating and cooking practices are influencing indoor air quality during normal daily activities.},

Researchers are examining the sensors for their potential use in a wide range of applications, including the examination of the spatial and temporal variability of particulate matter (PM). However, few studies have quantified the performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, and reliability) of the sensors under real-world conditions. This study examined the performance of two models of PM sensors, the AirBeam and the Alphasense Optical Particle Counter (OPC-N2), over a 12-week period in the Cuyama Valley of California, where PM concentrations are impacted by wind-blown dust events and regional transport. The sensor measurements were compared with observations from two well-characterized instruments: the GRIMM 11-R optical particle counter, and the Met One beta attenuation monitor (BAM). Both sensor models demonstrated a high degree of collocated precision (R2 = 0.8–0.99), and a moderate degree of correlation against the reference instruments (R2 = 0.6–0.76). Sensor measurements were influenced by the meteorological environment and the aerosol size distribution. Quantifying the performance of sensors in real-world conditions is a requisite step to ensuring that sensors will be used in ways commensurate with their data quality.},

In general, there was moderate spatial inhomogeneity, as indicated by multiple pairwise measures including coefficient of divergence and signed rank tests of the value distributions. Pearson correlation coefficients were often moderate ({\textasciitilde}50\% of units showed correlations \&gt;0.5 during the first season), indicating that there was some coherent variation across the area, likely driven by a combination of meteorological conditions (wind speed, direction, and mixed layer heights) and the concentration of PM2.5 being transported into the region. Although the accuracy of these PM sensors is limited, they are sufficiently precise relative to one another and to research grade instruments that they can be useful is assessing the spatial and temporal variations across an area and provide concentration estimates based on higher-quality central site monitoring data.},

	abstract = {To reduce inaccuracies in the measurement of air pollutants by portable monitors it is necessary to establish quantitative calibration relationships against their respective reference analyser. This is usually done under controlled laboratory conditions or one-off static co-location alongside a reference analyser in the field, neither of which may adequately represent the extended use of portable monitors in exposure assessment research. To address this, we investigated ways of establishing and evaluating portable monitor calibration relationships from repeated intermittent deployment cycles over an extended period involving stationary deployment at a reference site, mobile monitoring, and completely switched off. We evaluated four types of portable monitors: Aeroqual Ltd. (Auckland, New Zealand) S500 O3 metal oxide and S500 NO2 electrochemical; RTI (Berkeley, CA, USA) MicroPEM PM2.5; and, AethLabs (San Francisco, CA, USA) AE51 black carbon (BC). Innovations in our study included: (i) comparison of calibrations derived from the individual co-locations of a portable monitor against its reference analyser or from all the co-location periods combined into a single dataset; and, (ii) evaluation of calibrated monitor estimates during transient measurements with the portable monitor close to its reference analyser at separate times from the stationary co-location calibration periods. Within the {\textasciitilde}7 month duration of the study, ‘combined’ calibration relationships for O3, PM2.5, and BC monitors from all co-locations agreed more closely on average with reference measurements than ‘individual’ calibration relationships from co-location deployment nearest in time to transient deployment periods. ‘Individual’ calibrations relationships were sometimes substantially unrepresentative of the ‘combined’ relationships. Reduced quantitative consistency in field calibration relationships for the PM2.5 monitors may have resulted from generally low PM2.5 concentrations that were encountered in this study. Aeroqual NO2 monitors were sensitive to both NO2 and O3 and unresolved biases. Overall, however, we observed that with the ‘combined’ approach, ‘indicative’ measurement accuracy (±30\% for O3, and ±50\% for BC and PM2.5) for 1 h time averaging could be maintained over the 7-month period for the monitors evaluated here.},

Different weather phenomena cause interference in the wireless communication links which can therefore essentially act as a low cost sensor network, already deployed worldwide, for atmospheric monitoring. In this study we focus on the attenuation effect caused in commercial microwave networks due to gradients in the atmospheric refractive index with altitude as a result of the combination of temperature inversions and falls in the atmospheric humidity trapped beneath them. These conditions, when combined with high relative humidity near ground level are precursors to the creation of fog. The current work utilizes this novel approach to demonstrate the potential for detecting these preconditions of fog, a phenomenon associated with severe visibility limitations which can lead to dangerous accidents, injuries and loss of lives.},

The high cost of conventional instruments typically limits the number of monitoring sites, which in turn undermines the accuracy of real-time mapping of sources and hotspots of air pollutants with sufficient spatial resolution. In this study, a wireless network of low-cost particle sensors that can be deployed indoors was developed. To overcome the well-known limitations of low sensitivity and poor signal quality associated with low-cost sensors, a sliding window and a low pass filter were developed to enhance the signal quality. Utility of the networked system with improved sensitivity was demonstrated by deploying it in a woodworking shop. Data collected by the networked system was utilized to construct spatiotemporal PM concentration distributions using an ordinary Kriging method and an Artificial Neural Network model to elucidate particle generation and ventilation processes.},

However, in the diverse applications these sensors face many technological challenges, including sensor drift over long-term deployment that cannot be easily addressed using mathematical correction algorithms or machine learning methods. This study aims to develop a novel approach to auto-correct the drift of commonly used electrochemical nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor with comprehensive evaluation of its application. The impact of environmental factors on the NO2 electrochemical sensor in low-ppb concentration level measurement was evaluated in laboratory and the temperature and relative humidity correction algorithm was evaluated. An automated zeroing protocol was developed and assessed using a chemical absorbent to remove NO2 as a means to perform zero correction in varying ambient conditions. The sensor system was operated in three different environments in which data were compared to a reference NO2 analyzer. The results showed that the zero-calibration protocol effectively corrected the observed drift of the sensor output. This technique offers the ability to enhance the performance of low-cost sensor based systems and these findings suggest extension of the approach to improve data quality from sensors measuring other gaseous pollutants in urban air.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of the effects of air pollution on public health and human-wellbeing requires reliable data. Standard air quality monitoring stations provide accurate measurements of airborne pollutant levels, but, due to their sparse distribution, they cannot capture accurately the spatial variability of air pollutant concentrations within cities. Dedicated in-depth field campaigns have dense spatial coverage of the measurements but are held for relatively short time periods. Hence, their representativeness is limited. Moreover, the oftentimes integrated measurements represent time-averaged records. Recent advances in communication and sensor technologies enable the deployment of dense grids of Wireless Distributed Environmental Sensor Networks for air quality monitoring, yet their capability to capture urban-scale spatiotemporal pollutant patterns has not been thoroughly examined to date. Here, we summarize our studies on the practicalities of using data streams from sensor nodes for air quality measurement and the required methods to tune the results to different stakeholders and applications. We summarize the results from eight cities across Europe, five sensor technologies-three stationary (with one tested also while moving) and two personal sensor platforms, and eight ambient pollutants. Overall, few sensors showed an exceptional and consistent performance, which can shed light on the fine spatiotemporal urban variability of pollutant concentrations. Stationary sensor nodes were more reliable than personal nodes. In general, the sensor measurements tend to suffer from the interference of various environmental factors and require frequent calibrations. This calls for the development of suitable field calibration procedures, and several such in situ field calibrations are presented.},

Instead of adding meteorological sensors or dehumidification devices used widely in commercial PM2.5 measurement instruments, a novel particle sensor based on multi-angle light scattering and data fusion is proposed to eliminate the effect of meteorological factors. Three photodiodes are employed to collect the scattered light flux at three distinct angles. Weather index is defined as the ratio of scattered light fluxes collected at the 40° and 55° angles, which can be used to distinguish the mass median diameter variation caused by different meteorological parameters. Simulations based on Lorenz-Mie theory and field experiments establish the feasibility of this scheme. Experimental results indicate that mass median diameter has less effect on the photodiode at the 55° angle in comparison with photodiodes at the 40° angle and 140° angle. After correction using the weather index, the photodiode at the 40° angle yielded the best results followed by photodiodes at the 55° angle and the 140° angle.},

The results showed spatial variability of ozone at both deployment sites, with the largest differences between UPod measurements occurring during the afternoons. The peak median hourly difference between UPods was 6 ppb at 1:00 p.m. at the open space site, and 11 ppb at 4:00 p.m. at the urban site.

In this city, around 90\% of the total emissions of suspended particulate matter is caused by households burning wood. We created a simulated market in which households could choose among different combustion technologies with an assigned subsidy. The subsidy was a relevant factor in the decision to participate, and the inability to secure credit was a significant constraint for the participation of low-income households. Due to several practical difficulties and challenges associated with the implementation of large-scale programs that encourage technological innovation at the household level, it is strongly advisable to start with a small-scale pilot that can provide useful insights into the final design of a fuller, larger-scale program.},

For this, sensor units consisting of two boxes featuring NO2 and O3 low-cost sensors and wireless data transfer were engineered. The sensor units were initially operated at air quality monitoring sites for 3 months for performance analysis and initial calibration. Afterwards, they were relocated and operated within a sensor network consisting of six locations for more than 1 year. Our analyses show that the employed O3 and NO2 sensors can be accurate to 2–5 and 5–7 ppb, respectively, during the first 3 months of operation. This accuracy, however, could not be maintained during their operation within the sensor network related to changes in sensor behaviour. For most of the O3 sensors a decrease in sensitivity was encountered over time, clearly impacting the data quality. The NO2 low-cost sensors in our configuration exhibited better performance but did not reach the accuracy level of NO2 diffusion tubes (∼ 2 ppb for uncorrected 14-day average concentrations). Tests in the laboratory revealed that changes in relative humidity can impact the signal of the employed NO2 sensors similarly to changes in ambient NO2 concentration. All the employed low-cost sensors need to be individually calibrated. Best performance of NO2 sensors is achieved when the calibration models also include time-dependent parameters accounting for changes in sensor response over time. Accordingly, an effective procedure for continuous data control and correction is essential for obtaining meaningful data. It is demonstrated that linking the measurements from low-cost sensors to the high-quality measurements from routine air quality monitoring stations is an effective procedure for both tasks provided that time periods can be identified when pollutant concentrations can be accurately predicted at sensor locations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of blindly calibrating a mobile sensor network—i.e., determining the gain and the offset of each sensor—from heterogeneous observations on a defined spatial area over time. For that purpose, we propose to revisit blind sensor calibration as an informed Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem with missing entries. In the considered framework, one matrix factor contains the calibration structure of the sensors—and especially the values of the sensed phenomenon—while the other one contains the calibration parameters of the whole sensor network. The available information is taken into account by using a specific parameterization of the NMF problem. Moreover, we also consider additional NMF constraints which can be independently taken into account, i.e., an approximate constraint over the mean calibration parameters and a sparse approximation of the sensed phenomenon over a known dictionary. The enhancement of our proposed approaches is investigated through more than 5000 simulations and is shown to be accurate for the considered application and to outperform a multi-hop micro-calibration technique as well as a method based on low-rank matrix completion and nonnegative least squares.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensor technology can potentially revolutionise the area of air pollution monitoring by providing high-density spatiotemporal pollution data. Such data can be utilised for supplementing traditional pollution monitoring, improving exposure estimates, and raising community awareness about air pollution. However, data quality remains a major concern that hinders the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor technology. Unreliable data may mislead unsuspecting users and potentially lead to alarming consequences such as reporting acceptable air pollutant levels when they are above the limits deemed safe for human health. This article provides scientific guidance to the end-users for effectively deploying low-cost sensors for monitoring air pollution and people's exposure, while ensuring reasonable data quality. We review the performance characteristics of several low-cost particle and gas monitoring sensors and provide recommendations to end-users for making proper sensor selection by summarizing the capabilities and limitations of such sensors. The challenges, best practices, and future outlook for effectively deploying low-cost sensors, and maintaining data quality are also discussed. For data quality assurance, a two-stage sensor calibration process is recommended, which includes laboratory calibration under controlled conditions by the manufacturer supplemented with routine calibration checks performed by the end-user under final deployment conditions. For large sensor networks where routine calibration checks are impractical, statistical techniques for data quality assurance should be utilised. Further advancements and adoption of sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques for sensor calibration, fault detection, and data quality assurance can indeed help to realise the promised benefits of a low-cost air pollution sensor network.},

	abstract = {We describe an assessment of the impact on mortality of eight major sources of PM2.5 in the Greater Metropolitan Region of Sydney, Australia (GMR). We modeled exposure to PM2.5 for the year July 2010 to June 2011 and estimated the burden of current mortality attributable to these sources. We also estimated the number of life-years that would be produced if emissions from wood heaters and power stations, the two largest emissions sources, were reduced. Wood heaters (assuming a real-world emissions factor of 11.4 g of PM2.5 per kg of wood burned) were the most important source of PM2.5 exposure, responsible for around 24.0\% of the total anthropogenic PM2.5 concentration. On-road sources and power stations were also important, responsible for 16.9\% and 10.5\% of anthropogenic PM2.5 exposure respectively. Around 1.2\% of mortality (5,900 YLL) was attributable to long-term exposure to all anthropogenic PM2.5, including 0.3\% (1,400 YLL) attributable to wood heater–related PM2.5, 0.2\% (990 YLL) to on-road sources and 0.1\% (620 YLL) to power stations. Compared to ongoing emissions at 2010/11 levels, we estimated that a sustained reduction in emissions from wood heaters due to the introduction of an emissions standard of 1.5 g of PM2.5 per kilogram of wood burned (real world emissions factor of 3.9 g of PM2.5 per kg of wood burned) and the associated reduction in PM2.5 population exposure would produce 90,000 life-years among the cohort of people alive in 2010/11. Complete removal of sulphur oxide emissions from power stations would produce 14,000 life-years and complete removal of nitrogen oxide emissions would produce 38,000 life-years. A range of sensitivity analyses indicate the true impact of PM2.5 from these sources is likely to be at least as large as these estimates. This assessment shows that eight sources are responsible for more than 60\% of exposure to anthropogenic PM2.5 in the Sydney GMR. Although the burden of mortality attributable to each source is relatively small, interventions that achieve sustained reductions in emissions could provide substantial health benefits, which are likely to far outweigh the costs.},

	abstract = {Integration of low-cost air quality sensors with the internet of things (IoT) has become a feasible approach towards the development of smart cities. Several studies have assessed the performance of low-cost air quality sensors by comparing their measurements with reference instruments. We examined the performance of a low-cost IoT particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) sensor in the urban environment of Santiago, Chile. The prototype was assembled from a PM10–PM2.5 sensor (SDS011), a temperature and relative humidity sensor (BME280) and an IoT board (ESP8266/Node MCU). Field tests were conducted at three regulatory monitoring stations during the 2018 austral winter and spring seasons. The sensors at each site were operated in parallel with continuous reference air quality monitors (BAM 1020 and TEOM 1400) and a filter-based sampler (Partisol 2000i). Variability between sensor units (n = 7) and the correlation between the sensor and reference instruments were examined. Moderate inter-unit variability was observed between sensors for PM2.5 (normalized root-mean-square error 9–24\%) and PM10 (10–37\%). The correlations between the 1-h average concentrations reported by the sensors and continuous monitors were higher for PM2.5 (R2 0.47–0.86) than PM10 (0.24–0.56). The correlations (R2) between the 24-h PM2.5 averages from the sensors and reference instruments were 0.63–0.87 for continuous monitoring and 0.69–0.93 for filter-based samplers. Correlation analysis revealed that sensors tended to overestimate PM concentrations in high relative humidity (RH {\textgreater} 75\%) and underestimate when RH was below 50\%. Overall, the prototype evaluated exhibited adequate performance and may be potentially suitable for monitoring daily PM2.5 averages after correcting for RH.},

TROPOMI {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} total (summed) columns are compared with the measurements performed by the Pandora spectrometer between April and September 2018.

We find high correlation ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{r} = 0.68{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) between satellite- and ground-based data, but also that TROPOMI total columns underestimate ground-based observations for relatively large Pandora {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} total columns, corresponding to episodes of relatively elevated pollution. This is expected because of the relatively large size of the TROPOMI ground pixel ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}3.5×7{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;km) and the a priori used in the retrieval compared to the relatively small field-of-view of the Pandora instrument. On the other hand, TROPOMI slightly overestimates (within the retrieval uncertainties) relatively small {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} total columns. Replacing the coarse a priori {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} profiles with high-resolution profiles from the CAMS chemical transport model improves the agreement between TROPOMI and Pandora total columns for episodes of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} enhancement. When only the low values of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} total columns or the whole dataset are taken into account, the mean bias slightly increases. The change in bias remains mostly within the uncertainties.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We also analyse the consistency between satellite-based data and in situ {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} surface concentrations measured at the Helsinki–Kumpula air quality station (located a few metres from the Pandora spectrometer). We find similar day-to-day variability between TROPOMI, Pandora and in situ measurements, with {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} enhancements observed during the same days. Both satellite- and ground-based data show a similar weekly cycle, with lower {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} levels during the weekend compared to the weekdays as a result of reduced emissions from traffic and industrial activities (as expected in urban sites). The TROPOMI {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} maps reveal also spatial features, such as the main traffic ways and the airport area, as well as the effect of the prevailing south-west wind patterns.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This is one of the first works in which TROPOMI {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} retrievals are validated against ground-based observations and the results provide an early evaluation of their applicability for monitoring pollution levels in urban sites.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Wireless low-cost particulate matter sensor networks (WLPMSNs) are transforming air quality monitoring by providing particulate matter (PM) information at finer spatial and temporal resolutions. However, large-scale WLPMSN calibration and maintenance remain a challenge. The manual labor involved in initial calibration by collocation and routine recalibration is intensive. The transferability of the calibration models determined from initial collocation to new deployment sites is questionable, as calibration factors typically vary with the urban heterogeneity of operating conditions and aerosol optical properties. Furthermore, the stability of low-cost sensors can drift or degrade over time. This study presents a simultaneous Gaussian process regression (GPR) and simple linear regression pipeline to calibrate and monitor dense WLPMSNs on the fly by leveraging all available reference monitors across an area without resorting to pre-deployment collocation calibration. We evaluated our method for Delhi, where the PM{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2.5}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} measurements of all 22 regulatory reference and 10 low-cost nodes were available for 59\&thinsp;d from 1 January to 31 March 2018 (PM{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2.5}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} averaged {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}138±31{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}g\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} among 22 reference stations), using a leave-one-out cross-validation (CV) over the 22 reference nodes. We showed that our approach can achieve an overall 30\&thinsp;\% prediction error (RMSE: 33\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}g\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) at a 24\&thinsp;h scale, and it is robust as it is underscored by the small variability in the GPR model parameters and in the model-produced calibration factors for the low-cost nodes among the 22-fold CV. Of the 22 reference stations, high-quality predictions were observed for those stations whose PM{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2.5}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} means were close to the Delhi-wide mean (i.e., {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}138±31{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}g\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), and relatively poor predictions were observed for those nodes whose means differed substantially from the Delhi-wide mean (particularly on the lower end). We also observed washed-out local variability in PM{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2.5}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} across the 10 low-cost sites after calibration using our approach, which stands in marked contrast to the true wide variability across the reference sites. These observations revealed that our proposed technique (and more generally the geostatistical technique) requires high spatial homogeneity in the pollutant concentrations to be fully effective. We further demonstrated that our algorithm performance is insensitive to training window size as the mean prediction error rate and the standard error of the mean (SEM) for the 22 reference stations remained consistent at {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼30{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;\% and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼3{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;\%–4\&thinsp;\%, respectively, when an increment of 2\&thinsp;d of data was included in the model training. The markedly low requirement of our algorithm for training data enables the models to always be nearly the most updated in the field, thus realizing the algorithm's full potential for dynamically surveilling large-scale WLPMSNs by detecting malfunctioning low-cost nodes and tracking the drift with little latency. Our algorithm presented similarly stable 26\&thinsp;\%–34\&thinsp;\% mean prediction errors and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼3{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;\%–7\&thinsp;\% SEMs over the sampling period when pre-trained on the current week's data and predicting 1 week ahead, and therefore it is suitable for online{\textless}span id="page5162"/{\textgreater} calibration. Simulations conducted using our algorithm suggest that in addition to dynamic calibration, the algorithm can also be adapted for automated monitoring of large-scale WLPMSNs. In these simulations, the algorithm was able to differentiate malfunctioning low-cost nodes (due to either hardware failure or under the heavy influence of local sources) within a network by identifying aberrant model-generated calibration factors (i.e., slopes close to zero and intercepts close to the Delhi-wide mean of true PM{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2.5}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). The algorithm was also able to track the drift of low-cost nodes accurately within 4\&thinsp;\% error for all the simulation scenarios. The simulation results showed that {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼20{\textless}/span{\textgreater} reference stations are optimum for our solution in Delhi and confirmed that low-cost nodes can extend the spatial precision of a network by decreasing the extent of pure interpolation among only reference stations. Our solution has substantial implications in reducing the amount of manual labor for the calibration and surveillance of extensive WLPMSNs, improving the spatial comprehensiveness of PM evaluation, and enhancing the accuracy of WLPMSNs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Identifying causal relationships and quantifying their strength from observational time series data are key problems in disciplines dealing with complex dynamical systems such as the Earth system or the human body. Data-driven causal inference in such systems is challenging since datasets are often high dimensional and nonlinear with limited sample sizes. Here, we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm to estimate causal networks from large-scale time series datasets. We validate the method on time series of well-understood physical mechanisms in the climate system and the human heart and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real-world data. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detection power, which opens up entirely new possibilities to discover and quantify causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.

	abstract = {Low-cost optical particle counters (OPC) have gained increasing attention in recent years in exposure studies. Previous studies reported that the OPCs’ performance varies considerably with type of particles being measured; however, little information on their performance in monitoring common indoor aerosols is available. Given the significance of exposure to indoor aerosols and adverse health effects, this experimental study investigates the performances of low-cost OPCs in monitoring individual indoor aerosols that are commonly found indoors in a controlled chamber environment. Performances of four low-cost OPCs were examined under exposure to varying concentrations of biological (dust mite, pollen, cat, and dog fur) and non-biological (monodisperse silica and melamine resin) aerosols. Each particle sample was dispersed into the chamber using a computer-controlled syringe injection system and size-resolved particle number concentrations were simultaneously measured by four low-cost OPCs (OPC N2, IC Sentinel, Speck, and Dylos) as well as a lab-grade reference sensor (AeroTrak). The study results showed measurable effects of particle size, particle type, and concentration on the low-cost OPC responses. Particle concentration had the most dominant effect on the linearity of low-cost sensors. Results also revealed that the sensor responses to four biological particles follow a similar pattern and converge to a linear line as the number concentration increases above 5 cm−3. As for non-biological particles, the OPC responses were more varied depending on the particle type and size, especially in the concentration range {\textless}10 cm−3. Calibration equations developed in this study provide baseline information for correcting low-cost OPC readings when utilized to measure concentrations of individual indoor aerosol sources.},

Reducing pollution at its source can have a rapid and substantial impact on health. Within a few weeks, respiratory and irritation symptoms, such as shortness of breath, cough, phlegm, and sore throat, disappear; school absenteeism, clinic visits, hospitalizations, premature births, cardiovascular illness and death, and all-cause mortality decrease significantly. The interventions are cost-effective. Reducing factors causing air pollution and climate change have strong cobenefits. Although regions with high air pollution have the greatest potential for health benefits, health improvements continue to be associated with pollution decreases even below international standards. The large response to and short time needed for benefits of these interventions emphasize the urgency of improving global air quality and the importance of increasing efforts to reduce pollution at local levels.},

	abstract = {The field of small air quality sensors is of growing interest within the scientific community, especially because this new technology is liable to improve air pollutant monitoring as well as be used for personal exposure quantification. Amongst the myriad existing devices, the performances are highly variable; this is why the sensors must be rigorously assessed before deployment, according to the intended use. This study is included in the Polluscope project; its purpose is to quantify personal exposure to air pollutants by using portable sensors. This paper designs and applies a methodology for the evaluation of portable air quality sensors to eight devices measuring PM, BC, NO2 and O3. The dedicated testing protocol includes static ambient air measurements compared with reference instruments, controlled chamber and mobility tests, as well as reproducibility evaluation. Three sensors (AE51, Cairclip and Canarin) were retained to be used for the field campaigns. The reliability of their performances were robustly quantified by using several metrics. These three devices (for a total of 36 units) were deployed to be worn by volunteers for a week. The results show the ability of sensors to discriminate between different environments (i.e., cooking, commuting or in an office). This work demonstrates, first, the ability of the three selected sensors to deliver data reliable enough to enable personal exposure estimations, and second, the robustness of this testing methodology.},

Portable low-cost sensors hold promise to expand temporal and spatial coverage of air quality information. However, researchers have reported challenges in these sensors′ operational quality. We evaluated the performance characteristics of two widely used sensors, the Plantower PMS A003 and Shinyei PPD42NS, for measuring fine particulate matter compared to reference methods, and developed regional calibration models for the Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Baltimore, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Winston-Salem and Seattle metropolitan areas. Duplicate Plantower PMS A003 sensors demonstrated a high level of precision (averaged Pearson′s r = 0.99), and compared with regulatory instruments, showed good accuracy (cross-validated R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.15 µg/m3 for daily averaged PM2.5 estimates in the Seattle region). Shinyei PPD42NS sensor results had lower precision (Pearson′s r = 0.84) and accuracy (cross-validated R2 = 0.40, RMSE = 4.49 µg/m3). Region-specific Plantower PMS A003 models, calibrated with regulatory instruments and adjusted for temperature and relative humidity, demonstrated acceptable performance metrics for daily average measurements in the other six regions (R2 = 0.74–0.95, RMSE = 2.46–0.84 µg/m3). Applying the Seattle model to the other regions resulted in decreased performance (R2 = 0.67–0.84, RMSE = 3.41–1.67 µg/m3), likely due to differences in meteorological conditions and particle sources.

Anomalies are considered as data errors that are inconsistent to the actual physical phenomena. This paper presents an improved sensor calibration, which applies a process for detection and removal of anomalies before the sensor calibration process. A Bayesian-based method is used for anomaly detection that takes advantage of cross-sensitive parameters in a sensor array. The method utilises dependencies between cross-sensitive parameters, which allows underlying physical phenomena to be modelled and anomalies to be detected. The calibration approach is based on stepwise regression, which automatically and systematically selects suitable supporting parameters for a calibration function. The evaluation for anomaly detection shows that the results are better than the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of accuracy, precision and completeness. The overall evaluation confirms that data quality can be further enhanced when anomalies are removed before the calibration.},

PM1 samples were collected in an anthropized area of international attention close to oil/gas pre-treatment plants in Agri Valley (Southern Italy).

Further, air mass back-trajectory analyses suggest an important contribute to the long-range transport on PM1 at Agri Valley. The carcinogenic (Cd, Cr(VI), Ni, and Pb) and non-carcinogenic (Cd, Cr(VI), Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) health risks both for children and for adults were assessed using the United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) methods considering inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact pathway. Chromium (VI) posed the highest carcinogenic risk for both children and adults. The integrated carcinogenic risks were respectively 3.45 × 10−5 and 1.38 × 10−4 for children and adults indicating that attention should be paid for carcinogenic health effects. Nickel posed the highest non-carcinogenic risk for children through inhalation pathway. The integrated non-carcinogenic risk showed a value higher than 1 highlighting that Cd, Cr(VI), Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn may cause cumulative non-carcinogenic health effect for children from inhalation exposure.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet of things (IoTs) and modern industrial society, forecasting air pollution concentration, e.g., the concentration of PM2.5, is of great significance to protect human health and the environment. Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentrations is limited by the number and the data quality of air quality monitoring stations. In Taiwan, the spatial and temporal data of PM2.5 concentrations are measured by 77 national air quality monitoring stations (built by Taiwan EPA). However, the national stations are costly and scarce because of the highly precise instrument and their size. Therefore, many places are still out of coverage of the monitoring network. Recently, under the framework of IoTs, there are hundreds of portable air quality sensors called “AirBox” developed jointly by the Taiwan local government and a private company. By virtue of its low price and portability, the AirBox can provide a higher resolution of space-time PM2.5 measurement. However, the spatiotemporal distribution is different between AirBox and EPA stations, and data quality and accuracy of AirBox is poorer than national air quality monitoring stations. Thus, to integrate the heterogeneous PM2.5 data, the data fusion technique should be used before further analysis. In this study, we propose a new data fusion method called multi-sensor space-time data fusion framework. It is based on the Optimum Linear Data Fusion theory and integrating with a multi-time step Kriging method for spatial-temporal estimation. The method is used to do heterogeneous data fusion from different sources and data qualities. It is able to improve the estimation of PM2.5 concentration in space and time. Results have shown that by combining PM2.5 concentration data from 1176 low-cost AirBoxes as additional information in our model, the estimation of spatial-temporal PM2.5 concentration becomes better and more reasonable. The r2 of the validation regression model is 0.89. Under the approach proposed in this study, we made the information of the micro-sensors more reliable and improved the higher spatial-temporal resolution of air quality monitoring. It could provide very useful information for better spatial-temporal data analysis and further environmental management, such as air pollution source localization, health risk assessment, and micro-scale air pollution analysis.},

They are further associated with adverse health impacts within urban ecosystems. In order to manage and control deteriorating urban air quality, an efficient and effective urban air quality management plan is required consisting of systematic sampling, monitoring and analysis; modelling; and control protocols. Air quality monitoring is the essential and basic step that develops foundation of any management plan. The present research article describes a comprehensive methodology for establishing a systematic and robust air quality monitoring network in LMICs and strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of urban air quality management frameworks. It also describes step-by-step procedures for chemical characterization of both organic and inorganic constituents of ambient particulate matter along with molecular markers, which are essential to identify the corresponding sources of particulate matter, an integral part of air pollution monitoring protocol. Additionally, it discusses the need for coupling low cost wireless sensor-based stations with a limited number of manual and conventional real time ambient air monitoring stations in order to make it cost effective, yet robust. The article demonstrates that satellite-based remote sensing monitoring calibrated with ground level measurement has the potential for regional scale air quality monitoring that captures transport of transboundary pollution.},

The mean IQ was calculated as the average of Verbal and Performance score. Potential confounders were adjusted using multivariate general linear model. About 45\% of children had average or above-average IQ while the rest had below-average IQ. The mean scores for the arithmetic component of IQ were found to be significantly lower among solid biomass fuel users as compared to LPG users after adjusting for confounders. The mean IQ of LPG users were 5.58 points higher (95\% CI: 0.46 – 10.1) for the arithmetic component as compared to solid biomass users.

	abstract = {Urban air pollution poses a significant global health risk, but due to the high expense of measuring air quality, the amount of available data on pollutant exposure has generally been wanting. In recent years this has motivated the development of several cheap, portable air quality monitoring instruments. However, these instruments also tend to be unreliable, and thus the raw measurements require preprocessing to make accurate predictions of actual air quality conditions, making them an apt target for machine learning techniques. In this paper we use a dataset of measurements from a low cost air-quality instrument—the ODIN-SD—to examine which techniques are most appropriate, and the limitations of such an approach. From theoretical and experimental considerations, we conclude that a robust linear regression over measurements of air quality metrics, as well as relative humidity and temperature measurements produces the model with greatest accuracy. We also discuss issues of concept drift which occur in this context, and quantify how much training data is required to strike the right balance between predictive accuracy and efficient data collection.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen an explosion in data sources available for monitoring and prediction of environmental phenomena. While several inferential methods have been developed to make predictions on the underlying process by combining these data, an optimal sampling design for additional data collection in the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources has not yet been developed. Here, we provide an adaptive spatial design strategy based on a utility function that combines both prediction uncertainty and risk-factor criteria. Prediction uncertainty is obtained through a spatial data fusion approach based on fixed rank kriging that can tackle data with differing spatial supports and signal-to-noise ratios. We focus on the application of low-cost portable sensors, which tend to be relatively noisy, for air pollution monitoring, where data from regulatory stations as well as numeric modeling systems are also available. Although we find that spatial adaptive sampling designs can help to improve predictions and reduce prediction uncertainty, low-cost portable sensors are only likely to be beneficial if they are sufficient in number and quality. Our conclusions are based on a multi-factorial simulation experiment, and on a realistic simulation of pollutants in the Erie and Niagara counties in Western New York.},

Hourly atmospheric air quality variability and its relation to the recorded road traffic volume were analysed. The hourly PM1/PM10 and PM2.5/PM10 ratio averages showed a moderate correlation with the traffic volume estimator. The quantitative contribution of traffic to total PM2.5 pollution was estimated using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter applied on 1-min average PM2.5 concentrations. On most of the days the estimated hourly average share of traffic-related emissions in PM2.5 pollution was identified as clearly correlated with the traffic volume. The calculated daily average contribution ranged from 6 to 27\% on various days, and at a low urban background concentration it reached approximately 22\%.},

	abstract = {Repeat observations underpin our understanding of environmental processes but financial constraints often limit scientists’ ability to deploy dense networks of conventional commercial instrumentation. Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IOT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on six years of developmental work with Arduino open-source hardware and software and active field research, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Sensor design and schematics are described alongside an evaluation of pitfalls and future improvements for individual sensors and the workflow process. We show that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instruments for a fraction of the conventional cost. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a platform for scientists and educators to delve into low-cost sensor development. This will ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at higher spatial and temporal resolution from the local to global scales.},

	abstract = {Low-cost aerosol monitors can provide more spatially- and temporally-resolved data on ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations than are available from regulatory monitoring networks; however, concentrations reported by low-cost monitors are sometimes inaccurate. We investigated laboratory- and field-based approaches for calibrating low-cost PurpleAir monitors. First, we investigated the linearity of the PurpleAir response to NIST Urban PM and derived a laboratory-based gravimetric correction factor. Then, we co-located PurpleAirs with portable filter samplers at 15 outdoor sites spanning 3 × 3-km in Fort Collins, CO, USA. We evaluated whether PM2.5 correction factors calculated using ambient relative humidity data improved the accuracy of PurpleAir monitors (relative to reference filter samplers operated at 16.7 L min−1). We also (1) evaluated gravimetric correction factors derived from periodic co-locations with portable filter samplers and (2) compared PM2.5 concentrations measured using portable and reference filter samplers. Both before and after field deployment, a linear model relating NIST Urban PM concentrations reported by a tapered element oscillating microbalance and PurpleAir monitors (“PM2.5 ATM”) had R2 = 99\%; however, an F-test identified a significant lack of fit between the model and the data. The laboratory-based correction did not translate to the field. Over a 35-day period, time-averaged ambient PM2.5 concentrations and RHs measured during 72- and 48-h filter samples ranged from 1.5 to 8.3 μg m−3 and 47\%–77\%, respectively. Corrections calculated using ambient RH data increased the fraction of time-averaged PurpleAir PM2.5 concentrations that were within 20\% of the reference concentration from 24\% (for uncorrected measurements) to 66\%. Corrections derived from monthly, weekly, and concurrent in-field co-locations with portable filter samplers increased the fraction of time-averaged PurpleAir PM2.5 concentrations that were within 20\% of the reference to 48\%, 54\%, and 72\%. PM2.5 concentrations measured using portable filter samplers were within 20\% of the reference for 69\% of samples.},

This review covers recent research publications on RWC contributions to ambient PM in different regions of Europe, North America and Australasia, and on key species associated with RWC. Furthermore, factors governing emissions from wood stoves (as the typical appliance used in residential heating) are evaluated.

Prior work explores several challenges in the design of low-cost sensors, the reliability of these sensors, and their application for specific use-cases like pothole detection and pollution monitoring. However, the process of deployment of a drive-by sensing network at a city-scale is still unexplored. Despite the rise of ride-sharing services, there is still no way to optimally select vehicles from a fleet that can accomplish the sensing task by providing enough coverage of the city. In this paper, we propose Modulo -- a system to bootstrap drive-by sensing deployment by taking into consideration a variety of aspects such as spatiotemporal coverage, budget constraints. Further, Modulo is well-suited to satisfy unique deployment constraints such as colocations with other sensors (needed for gas and PM sensor calibration), etc. We compare Modulo with two baseline algorithms on real-world taxi and bus datasets. We find that Modulo marginally outperforms the two baselines for datasets with just random-routes vehicles such as taxis. However, it significantly outperforms the baselines when a fleet comprises of both taxis and fixed-route vehicles such as public transport buses. Finally, we present a real-deployment that uses Modulo to select vehicles for an air pollution sensing application.},

In view of it, many communities worldwide are collecting air quality data privately to influence their policy makers to make stricter provisions for reducing harmful emissions and thereby improving their quality of life. Likewise, in many German cities, a community of air quality monitors which rely on low-cost PM Sensors is gathering momentum. Such communities possess privately-owned \&amp; low-cost air quality monitoring devices that claim to accurately measure PM concentrations and are openly accessible via internet. One such initiative is an air quality monitoring network viz. “luftdaten.info”, which contains of more than 300 low-cost sensors that consistently obtains PM data, colloquially referred as fine dust, in the city of Stuttgart as well as its surrounding districts. Besides, eight stations are continuously monitoring PM concentration in Stuttgart; these are operated by the State Environmental Agency (LuBW- Landesanstalt für Umwelt Baden-Württemberg). Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences (HFT) has currently installed 7 low-cost PM sensors to monitor and study PM concentration in one of its projects. This study endeavors to relate PM 2.5 and PM 10.0 using low-cost sensors. It intends to investigate the reliability of the measured PM concentration using such low-costs sensors once these are placed horizontally and vertically apart and comparing the measures of the 7 sensors. Another objective is to compare the PM concentration measurements with a meteorological station operated by the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg in the vicinity. A correlation analysis is performed to develop understanding of relationships of PM concentration with meteorological parameters, viz. with respect to ambient temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed and wind direction. Furthermore, it attempts to develop a regression model using above listed meteorological parameters. Finally, deficiencies in the measurement of low-costs and its placement effects are commented. Further suggestions are made for improving the data capturing and analytical procedures while using low-cost sensors.},

In this regard, the appearance of affordable and accurate sensor devices to monitor air quality has made possible to obtain relevant data about the state of the air, and moreover, eminent institutions are interested in promoting the use of novel and more affordable tools for air pollution, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and European institutions, within a new approach to environmental surveillance, known as Next Generation Compliance and Enforcement technologies. On other hand, in order to get more reliable measurements, the use of machine learning to support adjustment or calibration process has been used in some studies to improve the performance of monitoring devices. On this paper, led by a group of specialists of the Chilean Superintendence of Environment (henceforth, SMA from its Spanish initials), a first approach case study related to the convenience of the usage of low-cost devices in environmental enforcement will be presented. The study was made in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago and considers the spatial distribution of different particulate matter sensors in the region. Some aspects regarding communication and technical issues are presented as well as the main findings about their performance. Results illustrate that low-cost sensors, aided by machine learning algorithms, could provide a reliable enough general screening of particulate matter within a large city, constituting a valuable decision-making tool for environmental oversight, as well as a powerful preventive and deterrent approach for compliance.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyze the short-term effects of atmospheric pollutant concentrations (PM10, NO2 and O3) and heat and cold waves on the number of pre-term births and cases of low birth weight related to Saharan dust advection and biomass combustion. The dependent variables used in this analysis were the total number of births, births with low weight ({\textgreater}2.500 g) and pre-term births ({\textless}37 weeks), that occurred at the province level. Data provided by the NSI included: days with Saharan dust intrusion or biomass advection classified in terms of information provided by MITECO for each of the nine regions in Spain. A representative city was selected for reach region in which the registered average daily concentrations of PM10, NO2 and O3 (μg/m3) were used. These were also provided by MITECO. The daily maximum and daily minimum temperature (°C) used was those registered by the meteorological observatory station located in each province capital, provided by AEMET. Using Poisson log linear regression models, the associated relative risks (RR) were measured as well as the population attributable risk (PAR) corresponding to the variables that resulted statistically significant at p {\textless} 0.05 for days with and without intrusion of natural particulate matter. The results obtained show that the days with Saharan dust intrusion or advections due to biomass combustion- beyond the impact of PM10, primary pollutants such as NO2 (in Saharan intrusions), heat waves and O3 - are associated with the number of births, low birth weight and pre-term birth. The RR and percent PAR of the pollutants and the heat waves are greater than those obtained for PM10. The results of this study indicate that days with natural particulate matter due to biomass combustion or advection of Saharan dust put pregnant women at risk.},

	abstract = {A first assessment of the spatial variability of ambient black carbon (BC) concentrations in the Greater Area of Athens (GAA) was carried out during an intensive wintertime campaign, when ambient levels are exacerbated by increased biomass burning for residential heating. Short-term daytime BC measurements were conducted at 50 sites (traffic and urban/suburban/regional background) and on-road along 12 routes. Daytime measurements were adjusted based on BC concentrations continuously monitored at a reference site. Indicative nighttime BC ambient concentrations were also measured at several residences across the area. Daytime BC concentrations recorded an average of 2.3 μg m-3 with considerable between-site variability. Concentrations at traffic sites were significantly higher (43\% on average), compared with the rest of the sites. Varying levels were observed between background site subtypes, with concentrations at urban background sites (located near the center of Athens and the port of Piraeus) being 34\% and 114\% higher, on average, than at suburban and regional background sites, respectively. The traffic intensity at the nearest road and the population and built density in the surrounding area of sites were recognized as important factors controlling BC levels. On-road concentration measurements (5.4 μg m-3 on average) enabled the identification of hot-spots in the road network, with peak levels encountered along motorways (13.5 μg m-3 on average). Nighttime measurements demonstrated that wintertime BC pollution, enhanced by residential biomass burning for heating, affects the entire Athens basin. The reference site in central Athens was found to be representative of the temporal variability for daytime and nighttime BC concentrations at background locations.},

	abstract = {Lower cost air quality sensors have the potential to provide air pollution information at higher spatial resolutions than traditional monitoring. Such information could be used to evaluate project and planning impacts plus disparities in air pollution health impacts across populations. However, lower cost air quality sensors have technical limitations, hardware sustainability considerations, and resource issues associated with deploying and managing a network in the public right of way. To help improve understanding about the uses and limitations, the City of Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability tested three types of low cost air quality sensor devices across various field and lab deployments in collaboration. The project supported multi-disciplinary partnership development between the City, Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Portland State University (PSU) researchers, Green Electronics Council (GEC) and multiple private sector partners. This paper details findings about sensor performance in various deployment configurations. Results highlight challenges and recommendations that can be used to improve interoperability for air quality sensor networks. Findings about maintenance planning and sensor sustainability to minimize electronics waste are also discussed. Through this testing design, it was established that lower cost air quality sensors are capable of measuring local roadside pollution signals in addition to urban background pollution. Establishing this pattern is key to using sensors to support additional planning and assessment questions.},

	abstract = {Background
Particle air pollution has adverse health effects, and low-cost monitoring among a large population group is an effective method for performing environmental health studies. However, concern about the accuracy of low-cost monitors has affected their popularization in monitoring projects.
Objective
To calibrate a low-cost particle monitor (HK-B3, Hike, China) through a controlled exposure experiment.
Methods
Our study used a MicroPEM monitor (RTI, America) as a standard particle concentration measurement device to calibrate the Hike monitors. A machine learning model was established to calibrate the particle concentration obtained by the low-cost PM2.5 monitors, and ten-fold validation was used to test the model. In addition, we used a linear regression model to compare the results of the machine learning model. A calibration method was established for the low-cost monitors, and it can be used to apply the monitors in future air pollution monitoring projects.
Results
The values of the random forest model calibration results and observations were more condensed around the regression line y = 0.99x + 0.05, and the R squared value (R2 = 0.98) was higher than that for the linear regression (R2 = 0.87). The random forest model showed better performance than the traditional linear regression model.
Conclusions
Our study provided an effective calibration method to support the accuracy of low-cost monitors. The machine learning method based on the calibration model established in our study can increase the effectiveness of future air pollution and health studies.},

To date, limited studies, if any, have been conducted to utilize low-cost sensor measurements to improve PM2.5 prediction with high spatiotemporal resolutions based on statistical models. Imperial County in California is an exemplary region with sparse Air Quality System (AQS) monitors and a community-operated low-cost network entitled Identifying Violations Affecting Neighborhoods (IVAN). This study aims to evaluate the contribution of IVAN measurements to the quality of PM2.5 prediction. We adopted the Random Forest algorithm to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at 1-km spatial resolution using three different PM2.5 datasets (AQS-only, IVAN-only, and AQS/IVAN combined). The results showed that the integration of low-cost sensor measurements is an effective way to significantly improve the quality of PM2.5 prediction with an increase of cross-validation (CV) R2 by ∼0.2. The IVAN measurements also contributed to the increased importance of emission source-related covariates and more reasonable spatial patterns of PM2.5. The remaining uncertainty in the calibrated IVAN measurements could still cause apparent outliers in the prediction model, highlighting the need for more effective calibration or integration methods to relieve its negative impact.},

	abstract = {Background
Evidence of health effects following early life exposure to short-to-medium duration of high pollution levels is extremely limited.
Objectives
We aimed to evaluate the associations between: 1. intrauterine exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from coal mine fire emissions and the frequencies of general practitioner attendances and dispensations of prescribed asthma inhalers, steroid skin creams, and antibiotics during the first year of life; 2. infant exposure and those outcomes during the year following the fire.
Methods
All participants were recruited from the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, Australia. Participants' 24-h average and hourly peak mine fire-specific PM2.5 exposures from 09/02/2014 to 31/03/2014 were estimated using chemical transport modelling. Outcome data were obtained from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from each child's birth to 31/12/2016. We used negative binomial and logistic regression models to independently assess risks of the outcomes associated with every 10 and 100 μg m−3 increase in average or peak PM2.5 exposure, respectively, while adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
We included 286 of 311 children whose parents consented to be linked, comprising 77 with no exposure, 88 with intrauterine exposure and 121 with exposure in infancy. 10- and 100- μg m−3 increases in average and peak PM2.5 exposure during infancy were associated with greater incidence of antibiotics being dispensed during the year following the fire: the adjusted incidence rate ratios were 1.24 (95\% CI 1.02, 1.50, p = 0.036) and 1.14 (1.00, 1.31, p = 0.048) respectively. No other significant associations were observed.
Conclusion
Exposure to coal mine fire emissions during infancy was associated with increased dispensing of antibiotics. This could reflect increased childhood infections or increased prescriptions of antibiotics in the year following the fire.},

In this study, we combine dispersion modeling and measurements from the Kansas City TRansportation local-scale Air Quality Study (KC-TRAQS) and use data fusion methods to characterize air quality. The KC-TRAQS study produced a rich dataset using both traditional and emerging measurement technologies. We used dispersion modeling to support field study design and analysis. In the study design phase, the presumptive placement of fixed monitoring sites and mobile monitoring routes have been corroborated using a research screening tool C-PORT to assess the spatial and temporal coverage relative to the entire study area extent. In the analysis phase, dispersion modeling was used in combination with observations to help interpret the KC-TRAQS data. We extended this work to use data fusion methods to combine observations from stationary, mobile measurements, and dispersion model estimates.},

There is a tendency to be stuck in pilots and smaller set-ups because the knowledge and innovation that is required for these projects and services can’t be obtained in organisations, where there is more focus on daily operations and maintaining service levels in welfare. At the same time there is a need for a scientific baseline in relation to move our urban areas towards a more sustainable future. Someone needs to deliver data that can document the challenges that cities stand up against reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This paper describes a case where the local university together with a research-based start-up company have taken an initiative to deploy and manage a network of multi-functional probes (MONTEM CityProbes) that contains a large number of sensors that can track a broad suite of environmental data in near real-time. The service is established with open data capabilities and with a hope to kickstart further innovations in smart city developments and to strengthen the IoT eco-system of the region. The specific example focusses on monitoring the air quality from 25 probes deployed in places with strategic importance and where there is heavy traffic intensity from fossil-fuelled motor vehicles.},

	abstract = {Air quality has gained much attention in recent years and is of great importance to protecting people’s health. Due to the influence of multiple factors, the limited air quality monitoring stations deployed in cities are unable to provide fine-grained air quality information. One cost-effective way is to infer air quality with records from existing monitoring stations. However, the severe data sparsity problem (e.g., only 0.2\% data are known) leads to the failure of most inference methods. We observe that remote sensing data are of high quality and have a strong correlation with the air quality. Therefore, we propose to integrate remote sensing data and ubiquitous urban data for the air quality inference. But there are two main challenges, i.e., data heterogeneity and incompleteness of the remote sensing data. To address the challenges, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we infer and predict air quality conditions of some places leveraging the remote sensing data and meteorological data with two proposed ANN-based methods, respectively. This stage significantly alleviates the data sparsity problem. In the second stage, the records and estimated air quality data are put in a tensor. A tensor decomposition method is applied to complete the tensor. The features extracted from urban data are classified into the spatial features (i.e., road features and POI features) and the temporal features (i.e., meteorological features) as the constraints to further address the data sparsity problem. In addition, an iterative training framework is proposed to improve the inference performance. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as U-Air.},

While participants with previous pulmonary tuberculosis had a lower pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (mean − 0.7 SDs, 95\% CI − 0.92 to − 0.57), FVC (− 0.52 SDs, 95\% CI − 0.69 to − 0.33) and FEV1/FVC (− 0.59 SDs, 95\% CI − 0.76 to − 0.43) as compared to those who did not, we did not find an association between HAP exposure and previous pulmonary tuberculosis (adjusted odds ratio = 0.86; 95\% CI 0.56–1.32).ConclusionsThere was no association between HAP exposure and self-reported previous pulmonary tuberculosis in five population-based studies conducted worldwide.},

	abstract = {Small-scale heterogeneity of airborne pollutants may have implications for accurate exposure estimation in environmental health studies. However, it has been studied thus far mainly near main roads and over relatively short periods. The emergence of low-cost miniature particle sensors enables deployment of multi-sensor nodes for studying the spatial variability of ambient pollutants at fine spatial scales for extended time periods. We carried out measurements of fine ambient particles, both in terms of particle number concentrations (PNC; 0.3 {\textless} d {\textless} 3 μm) and particle mass concentrations (PM2.5; 0.3 {\textless} d {\textless} 2.5 μm), for more than three months (Dec 2015–Mar 2016; N = 1953 h) using a distributed network of optical particle counters. The network consisted of seven nodes that were deployed in a residential urban area, five nodes in one neighborhood ({\textasciitilde}1.5 km2) and two nodes in neighboring neighborhoods. While collocated with a reference monitoring instrument the sensors' readings were highly correlated (Pearson's r {\textgreater} 0.9; RMSE {\textasciitilde}5 μg m−3) and the variance of the observations when the reference PM2.5 measurements were {\textless}20 μg m−3 ({\textasciitilde}90\% of the records) was very low. Significantly higher heterogeneity was observed during the sensor deployment in the neighborhood, suggesting spatial variability of airborne particles at the neighborhood scale. Studying the spatial variability during different conditions (meteorological, day of the week, time of day) revealed signatures of human activity, suggesting specific sources that possibly contribute to the observed inner-neighborhood variability.},

	abstract = {Few air pollutant studies within the Palestinian territories have been reported in the literature. In March\&ndash;April and May\&ndash;June of 2018, three low-cost, locally calibrated particulate monitors (AirU\&rsquo;s) were deployed at different elevations and source areas throughout the city of Nablus in Northern West Bank, Palestine. During each of the three-week periods, high but site-to-site similar particulate matter less than 2.5 \&micro;m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and less than 10 \&micro;m (PM10) concentrations were observed. The PM2.5 concentrations at the three sampling locations and during both sampling periods averaged 38.2 \&plusmn; 3.6 \&micro;g/m3, well above the World Health Organization\&rsquo;s (WHO) 24 h guidelines. Likewise, the PM10 concentrations exceeded or were just below the WHO\&rsquo;s 24 h guidelines, averaging 48.5 \&plusmn; 4.3 \&micro;g/m3. During both periods, short episodes were identified in which the particulate levels at all three sites increased substantially (\&asymp;2\&times;) above the regional baseline. Air mass back trajectory analyses using U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\&rsquo;s (NOAA) Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model suggested that, during these peak episodes, the arriving air masses spent recent days over desert areas (e.g., the Saharan Desert in North Africa). On days with regionally low PM2.5 concentrations (\&asymp;20 \&micro;g/m3), back trajectory analysis showed that air masses were directed in from the Mediterranean Sea area. Further, the lower elevation (downtown) site often recorded markedly higher particulate levels than the valley wall sites. This would suggest locally derived particulate sources are significant and may be beneficial in the identification of potential remediation options.},

	abstract = {Many populations spend ∼90\% of their time indoors, with household particulate matter being linked to millions of premature deaths worldwide. Particulate matter is currently measured using particle mass, particle number, and particle size distribution metrics, with other metrics, such as particle surface area, likely to be of increasing importance in the future. Particulate mass is measured using gravimetric methods, tapered element oscillating microbalances, and beta attenuation instruments and is best suited to use in compliance monitoring, trend analysis, and high spatial resolution measurements. Particle number concentration is measured by condensation particle counters, optical particle counters, and diffusion chargers. Particle number measurements are best suited to source characterization, trend analysis and ultrafine particle investigations. Particle size distributions are measured by gravimetric impactors, scanning mobility particle sizers, aerodynamic particle sizers, and fast mobility particle sizers. Particle size distribution measurements are most useful in source characterization and particulate matter property investigations, but most measurement options remain expensive and intrusive. However, we are on the cusp of a revolution in indoor air quality monitoring and management. Low-cost sensors have potential to facilitate personalized information about indoor air quality (IAQ), allowing citizens to reduce exposures to PM indoors and to resolve potential dichotomies between promoting healthy IAQ and energy efficient buildings. Indeed, the low cost will put this simple technology in the hands of citizens who wish to monitor their own IAQ in the home or workplace, to inform lifestyle decisions. Low-cost sensor networks also look promising as the solution to measuring spatial distributions of PM indoors, however, there are important sensor/data quality, technological, and ethical barriers to address with this technology. An improved understanding of epidemiology is essential to identify which metrics correlate most with health effects, allowing indoor specific PM standards to be developed and to inform the future of experimental applications.},

	abstract = {In the past years, multiple research projects have explored the potential of low-cost environmental sensors for urban air pollution monitoring. However, each project has taken its own independent and in many cases, fully or partially closed approach. We present the Smart Citizen System, a flexible, easy-to-use and fully open-source environmental monitoring solution for particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, noise levels, and many other indicators. The use of low-cost sensors in recent years has been generally approached in two different ways citizen science and educational activities, where the primary purpose is to engage citizens in the measurement process and raise awareness of environmental concerns; and a more sophisticated scientific approach, where the main aim is to study the potentiality of the low-cost sensing technologies. The Smart Citizen System balances modularity with integration to fulfil both needs by providing an extendable solution, with different ranges of sensors based on the same core components. With that aim, two solutions have been developed: the Smart Citizen Kit, intended for citizen science and awareness activities; and the Smart Citizen Station, designed to serve as a more complex and accurate set of air pollution sensors. The design is based on the principle of reproducibility, also integrating non-hardware components such as a dedicated storage platform and a sensor analysis framework. The core system bases its sensing capabilities in widely reviewed low-cost sensors and aims to provide a robust framework for environmental monitoring activities. By making everything open, from the hardware to the software platform or the sensor post-processing algorithms, we hope others might find it useful as a development platform allowing them to focus on their project particular needs instead of reinventing everything from the ground-up.},

	abstract = {A growing number of companies have started commercializing low-cost sensors (LCS) that are said to be able to monitor air pollution in outdoor air. The benefit of the use of LCS is the increased spatial coverage when monitoring air quality in cities and remote locations. Today, there are hundreds of LCS commercially available on the market with costs ranging from several hundred to several thousand euro. At the same time, the scientific literature currently reports independent evaluation of the performance of LCS against reference measurements for about 110 LCS. These studies report that LCS are unstable and often affected by atmospheric conditions\&mdash;cross-sensitivities from interfering compounds that may change LCS performance depending on site location. In this work, quantitative data regarding the performance of LCS against reference measurement are presented. This information was gathered from published reports and relevant testing laboratories. Other information was drawn from peer-reviewed journals that tested different types of LCS in research studies. Relevant metrics about the comparison of LCS systems against reference systems highlighted the most cost-effective LCS that could be used to monitor air quality pollutants with a good level of agreement represented by a coefficient of determination R2 \&gt; 0.75 and slope close to 1.0. This review highlights the possibility to have versatile LCS able to operate with multiple pollutants and preferably with transparent LCS data treatment.},

To surpass such issues, a novel paradigm becomes attractive that, once a specific domain is given, allows the creation of a system capable to virtually augment the sensor network, i.e. providing measurement estimation where sensors are unavailable. This kind of approach s particularly focused on training a target Neural Network model, which outlines environmental issues, on urban areas provided with large sensor network, and then to make other areas, equipped with poor sensor networks, take advantage of the same model.

	abstract = {Low-cost particulate matter (PM) air quality sensors are becoming widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and home/workplace environments due to their low cost, compactness, and ability to provide more highly resolved spatiotemporal PM concentrations. However, the PM data from these sensors are often of questionable quality, and the sensors need to be characterized individually for the environmental conditions under which they will be making measurements. In this study, we designed and assessed a cost-effective (∼\$700) calibration chamber capable of continuously providing a uniform PM concentration simultaneously to multiple low-cost PM sensors and robust calibration relationships that are independent of sensor position. The chamber was designed and evaluated with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and a rigorous experimental protocol. We then used this new chamber to calibrate 242 Plantower PMS 3003 sensors from two production lots (Batches I and II) with two aerosol types: ammonium nitrate (for Batches I and II) and alumina oxide (for Batch I). Our CFD models and experiments demonstrated that the chamber is capable of providing uniform PM concentration to 8 PM sensors at once within 6\% error and with excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient {\textgreater} 0.771). The study identified two malfunctioning sensors and showed that the remaining sensors had high linear correlations with a DustTrak monitor that was calibrated for each aerosol type (R2 {\textgreater} 0.978). Finally, the results revealed statistically significant differences between the responses of Batches I and II sensors to the same aerosol (P-value{\textless}0.001) and the Batch I sensors to the two different aerosol types (P-value{\textless}0.001). This chamber design and evaluation protocol can provide a useful tool for those interested in systematic laboratory characterization of low-cost PM sensors.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, a range of sensor technologies became available on the market, enabling a revolutionary shift in air pollution monitoring and assessment. With their cost of up to three orders of magnitude lower than standard/reference instruments, many avenues for applications have opened up. In particular, broader participation in air quality discussion and utilisation of information on air pollution by communities has become possible. However, many questions have been also asked about the actual benefits of these technologies. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive literature search including both the scientific and grey literature. We focused upon two questions: (1) Are these technologies fit for the various purposes envisaged? and (2) How far have these technologies and their applications progressed to provide answers and solutions? Regarding the former, we concluded that there is no clear answer to the question, due to a lack of: sensor/monitor manufacturers’ quantitative specifications of performance, consensus regarding recommended end-use and associated minimal performance targets of these technologies, and the ability of the prospective users to formulate the requirements for their applications, or conditions of the intended use.  Numerous studies have assessed and reported sensor/monitor performance under a range of specific conditions, and in many cases the performance was concluded to be satisfactory, e.g.  (Castell et al. 2017, Han et al. 2017, Sousan et al. 2017). The specific use cases for sensors/monitors included outdoor in a stationary mode, outdoor in a mobile mode, indoor environments and personal monitoring.  Under certain conditions of application, project goals, and monitoring environments, some sensors/monitors were fit for a specific purpose. Based on analysis of 17 large projects, which reached applied outcome stage, and typically conducted by consortia of organizations, we observed that a sizable fraction of them ({\textasciitilde} 30\%) were commercial and/or crowd-funded. This fact by itself signals a paradigm change in air quality monitoring, which previously had been primarily implemented by government organizations.  An additional paradigm-shift indicator is the growing use of machine learning or other advanced data processing approaches to improve sensor/monitor agreement with reference monitors. There is still some way to go in enhancing application of the technologies for source apportionment, which is of particular necessity and urgency in developing countries. Also, there has been somewhat less progress in wide-scale monitoring of personal exposures. However, it can be argued that with a significant future expansion of monitoring networks, including indoor environments, there may be less need for wearable or portable sensors/monitors to assess personal exposure. Traditional personal monitoring would still be valuable where spatial variability of pollutants of interest is at a finer resolution than the monitoring network can resolve.},

A total of 62 sets of measurements were made at three different times of day (during morning rush hour, mid-afternoon, and during afternoon rush hour) from June 5 to July 7, 2017. Spatially, there was a significant difference in PM2.5 concentrations among the four residential neighborhoods. Overall, the Chestnut Hill neighborhood had the highest PM2.5 concentrations (13.25 ± 6.89 μg/m3), followed by Tioga (9.58 ± 4.83 μg/m3), Northern Liberties (7.02 ± 4.17 μg/m3), and Mill Creek (3.9 ± 4.5 μg/m3). There was temporal variability of pollutants depending on the neighborhood; Northern Liberties demonstrated the highest temporal variability in these data. The highest PM2.5 (18.86 ± 3.17 μg/m3) was measured in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood during morning rush hour. Mean PM2.5, BC, and noise levels based on mobile measurements at Philadelphia during summer 2017 were 8.41 ± 4.31 μg/m3, 0.99 ± 0.44 μg C/m3, and 62.01 ± 3.20 dBA, respectively. Environmental noise showed the highest temporal variation of the monitored components for 3 time periods. Generally, an increase in tree cover led to a decrease in PM2.5.},

	abstract = {Large volumes of real-world observation and measurement data are collected from sensory devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT data is often generated in highly distributed and dynamic environments. Continuous transmission of large volumes of data collected between sensor and head/sink nodes induces a high communication cost for individual nodes. This results in a significant increase in the overall energy cost for IoT applications such as environmental monitoring. Decreasing data transmission between nodes can effectively reduce energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime, especially in battery-powered nodes/networks. In this paper, we describe an Adaptive Method for Data Reduction (AM-DR), a data reduction approach for reducing the overall data transmission and communication between sensor nodes in IoT networks such that fine-grained sensor readings can be used to reconstruct the original data within a user-defined accuracy boundary. Evaluation with real-world data shows that AM-DR achieves a communication reduction in some scenarios up to 95\% while retaining a high prediction accuracy. To fully achieve the energy savings enabled by AM-DR, we provide a communication cost model. The proposed model is also integrated into the LEACH protocol to demonstrate how our proposed approach reduces energy consumption and effectively prolongs the network lifetime.},

The particular case of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, miniaturization, and power and cost efficiency were the major aspects taken into account in the research presented here. The considered systems focus on living spaces, classrooms, university amphitheaters and laboratories, and office buildings, and target the achievement of a lifetime of the measurement devices as long as possible. Our experimental results indicate an operating period between a couple of months and three years for wireless sensing devices powered by a single off-the-shelf battery, depending on the measurement and transmission rates.

	abstract = {A variety of low-cost sensors are now available on the consumer market for measuring air pollutants. The use of these low-cost sensors for ambient air monitoring applications is increasing and includes fence-line or near-source monitoring, community monitoring, emergency response, hot-spot identification, mobile monitoring, epidemiological studies, and supplemental monitoring to improve the spatial-temporal resolution of current monitoring networks. Evaluating and understanding the performance of these devices is necessary to properly interpret the results and reduce confusion when low-cost sensor measurements are not in agreement with measurements from regulatory-grade instrumentation. Systematic and comprehensive field and laboratory studies comparing low-cost sensors with regulatory-grade instrumentation are necessary to characterize sensor performance. This paper presents the results of 12 particulate matter (PM) sensors measurement of PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) tested under ambient conditions against a federally equivalent method (FEM) instrument at an ambient air monitoring station in Riverside, CA spanning over a 3-year period from 02/05/15 to 03/27/18. Sensors were evaluated in triplicate with a typical time duration of 8-week. Performance evaluation results found 6 of the 12 sensor triplicates with average R2 values ≥ 0.70 for PM2.5 concentrations less than 50 μg/m3. Within this subset, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ranged from 4.4 to 7.0 μg/m3 indicating the need for caution when interpreting data from these sensors. Additional analysis revealed that the impact of relative humidity on sensor performance varied between models with several models exhibiting increased bias error with increasing humidity. Results indicate that a number of these sensors have potential as useful tools for characterizing PM2.5 levels in ambient environments when data is interpreted and understood correctly with regard to existing ambient air quality networks. The performance evaluation results are specific for Riverside, CA under non-repeatable ambient weather conditions and particle properties with the expectation that performance evaluation testing at other locations with different particle properties and weather conditions would yield similar but non-identical results.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the air quality has become one of the most important problem in modern cities. The particulate matters in the air represents one of the principal causes of respiratory problems. The industrial products and the vehicular traffic had contributed to several phenomena in the increasing of atmospheric pollutants as ammonia, carbon dioxide, PM and so on. Although the importance regarding the monitoring of this substances, in the European countries still be a low number of air quality measurement stations probably due to the high cost of them and the not neglectable dimensions. However, in recent years, low-cost sensors for the air-quality have grown up in several private applications. These sensors are characterized by poor metrological performances that not enable the use of them in a public scenario agreeing with the European law in term of air quality. The authors, in this paper, present a possible integration of a low-cost air quality sensors for the monitoring of PM10 particles in a modern short-range Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) usually adopted in Smart Cities for Smart Metering applications (Gas and Water). The use of a high number of those sensors, thanks to the WSN, will be used to make up for the lack of measurement quality exhibited by the single sensor. The feasibility of the proposal will be demonstrated against the real measurement of two fixed air quality station in Campania region (Italy).},

However, in particular, non-technical challenges still hinder the broader development and application of LCSNs. This paper reviews the development of LCSNs over the last 15 years, highlighting trends and future opportunities for a diverse range of environmental applications. We found air quality, meteorological and water-related networks were particularly well represented with few studies focusing on sensor networks for ecological systems. Furthermore, we identified bias towards studies that have direct links to human health, safety and livelihoods. These studies were more likely to involve downstream data analytics, visualisations, and multi-stakeholder participation through citizen science initiatives. However, there was a paucity of studies that considered sustainability factors for the development and implementation of LCSNs. Existing LCSNs are largely focussed on detecting and mitigating events which have a direct impact on humans such as flooding, air pollution or geo-hazards, while these applications are important there is a need for future development of LCSNs for monitoring ecosystem structure and function. Our findings highlight three distinct opportunities for future research to unleash the full potential of LCSNs: (1) improvement of links between data collection and downstream activities; (2) the potential to broaden the scope of application systems and fields; and (3) to better integrate stakeholder engagement and sustainable operation to enable longer and greater societal impacts.},

The introduction of non-regulatory PM2.5 monitors presents both opportunities and challenges to researchers and air quality managers. In this study, we evaluated the advantages and limitations of integrating non-regulatory PM2.5 measurements into a satellite-based daily PM2.5 model at 100 m resolution in New York City in 2015. Two separate machine learning models were developed, one using only PM2.5 data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the other with measurements from both EPA and the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS). The EPA-only model obtained a cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.85 while the EPA + NYCCAS model obtained a CV R2 of 0.73. With the help of the NYCCAS measurements, the EPA + NYCCAS model predicted distinctly different PM2.5 spatial patterns and more pollution hotspots compared with the EPA model, and its predictions were {\textgreater}15\% higher than the EPA model along major roads and in densely populated areas. Our results indicated that satellite AOD and non-regulatory PM2.5 measurements can be fused together to capture neighborhood-scale PM2.5 levels and previous studies may have underestimated the disease burden due to PM2.5 in densely populated areas.},

Recently, the LCS research community has focused largely on sensor calibration, pollution monitoring, and exposure assessment; here, we investigate the applicability of LCS for characterizing particulate pollution sources in an urban environment. Using an integrated multipollutant LCS system (which measures both gases and particles), we collected air quality data for 6 weeks during the winter at a site in Delhi, India. The results were compared to measurements taken by co-located research-grade particle instruments. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to deconvolve LCS data into unique factors that were then identified by examining the factor composition and comparing them to the research-grade measurements. The data were described well by three factors: a combustion factor characterized by high CO levels and two factors characterized by measured particles. These factors align well with measurements by research-grade instruments, including particle types determined from factor analysis of online particle composition measurements. This work demonstrates that multipollutant LCS measurements, despite their inherent limitations (e.g., calibration challenges and inability to measure smallest particles), can provide insight into sources of fine particulate matter in a complex urban environment.},

However, the quality of the data from these sensor networks can be questioned, especially in poorly correlated environments. Sensors can be individually calibrated in a laboratory environment before deployment of the network, but this approach is unfeasible for large networks. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel online, autonomous approach to sensor calibration, by leveraging the ground truth measurements of the GS to calibrate neighboring nodes of the sensor network using a Recursive Least-Squares technique. Our algorithm percolates this calibration through the network such that every connected node will converge towards its ideal linear calibration. The algorithm outperforms a pre-deployment laboratory calibration and provides good tracking of quickly-changing environmental stimulus, which is known to change the inherent sensor calibration. Experimental results show a 45\% improvement in estimated measurement error when compared to measurements corrected using a laboratory calibration.},

	abstract = {The upcoming IoE paradigm is taking the IoT era to a new shift, and that because of the natural inter-connection of processes, people, devices and stakeholders. From the smart city perspective, the main goal is to make well-informed decisions, on the base of a variable number of sensors and sources, exposing different data with different protocols and structures. The urban contexts may change, and with them, the number of sensors deployed. The novel smart city service must go beyond an integration strategy, it needs an exploitation model to optimally retrieve useful and highly contextualized information. In this paper we focus on the development of a model which fuses together the IoE potential and machine learning techniques for the cognitive smart city: retrive useful intelligent information, optimally exploiting the infrastructure the specific physical context may offer. We propose an approach and related techniques for realizing context agnostic services, namely services that do not depend on the enabling infrastructure beneath. The purpose is to create an IoE-based self-contextualizing service, which potentially consider the entire range of data that is being collected in smart cities and use such data to provide highly-personalized information about each environment, i.e., information that best suits the context of each Smart City. To prove the proposed context agnostic service, we take into account the air quality observation issue: we provide two high-contextualized informative services to leverage data related to two different physical environments, thus building location awareness for different geographic areas and stakeholders. But still managed by the same application which can adapts itself. Finally we present the evaluation of this prototype to illustrate the benefits of our solution and the future work.},

	abstract = {The use of low-cost sensors for air quality measurements is expanding rapidly, with an associated rise in the number of citizens measuring air quality themselves. This has major implications for traditional air quality monitoring as performed by Environmental Protection Agencies. Here we reflect on the experiences of the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) with the use of low-cost sensors, particularly NO2 and PM10/PM2.5-sensors, and related citizen science, over the last few years. Specifically, we discuss the Dutch Innovation Program for Environmental Monitoring, which comprises the development of a knowledge portal and sensor data portal, new calibration approaches for sensors, and modelling and assimilation techniques for incorporating these uncertain sensor data into air pollution models. Finally, we highlight some of the challenges that come with the use of low-cost sensors for air quality monitoring, and give some specific use-case examples. Our results show that low-cost sensors can be a valuable addition to traditional air quality monitoring, but so far, their use in official monitoring has been limited. More research is needed to establish robust calibration methods while ongoing work is also aimed at a better understanding of the public\&rsquo;s needs for air quality information to optimize the use of low-cost sensors.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that mobile sampling can improve the spatial granularity of land use regression (LUR) models. Mobile sampling campaigns deploying low-cost ({\textless}\$300) air quality sensors could potentially offer an inexpensive and practical approach to measure and model air pollution concentration levels. In this study, we developed LUR models for street-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration levels in Seoul, South Korea. 169 h of data were collected from an approximately three week long campaign across five routes by ten volunteers sharing seven AirBeams, a low-cost (\$250 per unit), smartphone-based particle counter, while geospatial data were extracted from OpenStreetMap, an open-source and crowd-generated geographical dataset. We applied and compared three statistical approaches in constructing the LUR models – linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), and stacked ensemble (SE) combining multiple machine learning algorithms – which resulted in cross-validation R2 values of 0.63, 0.73, and 0.80, respectively, and identification of several pollution ‘hotspots.’ The high R2 values suggest that study designs employing mobile sampling in conjunction with multiple low-cost air quality monitors could be applied to characterize urban street-level air quality with high spatial resolution, and that machine learning models could further improve model performance. Given this study design's cost-effectiveness and ease of implementation, similar approaches may be especially suitable for citizen science and community-based endeavors, or in regions bereft of air quality data and preexisting air monitoring networks, such as developing countries.},

	abstract = {Air pollution in urban areas is a problem of complex nature and one of its principal characteristics is the variability of pollutants concentrations even at short distances from main road arteries. Nevertheless, the common approach for air pollution monitoring is by means of fixed stations, which are expensive, complex and provide low spatial resolution data, as they are low density deployed. These stations satisfy legislative requirements but do not provide data about local gradients of pollutants concentrations that can be significant for health protection: space–time variables are increasingly important to adequately characterise urban air quality. A possible solution to increment spatial resolution data in a city is by means of low-cost sensors, which are small and portable. Although these sensors do not allow the same accuracy and precision as certified analysers, they are increasingly used and tested all over the world and have the potential to integrate regulatory air pollution monitoring stations and promoting community engagement. In this paper LILI-1, a prototype of a low-cost air quality platform, is presented. It allows measuring meteoclimatic parameters and concentrations of principal air quality pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5) by means of electrochemical and optical sensors. LILI-1 has been tested in the city of Rome and compared with certified analysers, showing very encouraging results for all the monitored pollutants. It has also been used by mounting it on a bicycle and showing its ability to increment spatial resolution and obtain distributed data throughout the city.},

To date, this is the first segmentation model dealing with public perception in cities contaminated by woodsmoke. A survey (N = 489) was conducted in Temuco and Padre las Casas, Chile, which included questions regarding attitudes, sociodemographic factors, and health care behaviors, to obtain information for mitigation initiatives. Through a cluster analysis, three population segments were identified that related differently to environmental pollution, which were constructed based on seven psychosocial variables. Different sociodemographic profiles and self-reported behavioral patterns were found, which should guide policies aimed at improving air quality in cities contaminated by pollution from wood-burning stoves.},

	abstract = {A cost-effective, miniature electrical ultrafine particle sizer (mini- eUPS) has been developed for future UFP (ultrafine particle) monitoring networks in cities with high traffic density and in communities close to freeways, airports or stationary combustion sources. The mini- eUPS mainly consists of a mini-plate unipolar particle charger, a mini-plate differential mobility classifier and a mini- particle Faraday cage with a sensitive electrometer. A custom-made circuit board was designed for operating the mini- eUPS. In addition to the primary function of measuring the UFP size distribution, the mini- eUPS records the temperature, relative humidity, pressure, altitude, timing and location for each measured data set. The operational status of the mini- eUPS is also registered for data quality assurance. Due to the built-in features of self-diagnosis, malfunction reporting and wireless networking, this particle sizer is suitable for UFP monitoring network. The prototype, which possesses overall dimensions of 6.5′′ (L) × 5.0′′ (W) × 4′′ (H) and a total weight of {\textasciitilde}1.0 kg, measures particles ranging in size from 5 to 200 nm. To evaluate the performance of the mini- eUPS, size distribution measurements of lab-generated particles in both unimodal and bimodal distributions and of UFPs emitted from a low-cost 3D printer and diesel engine were compared with those taken by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS; TSI Inc.). A reasonably good agreement between the mini- eUPS and SMPS data was found.},

Instrumentation to assess potential solutions to this problem faces challenges\&mdash;especially related to cost. A low-cost (\$159) particulate matter tool called the Household Air Pollution Exposure (HAPEx) Nano was evaluated in the field as part of the Prices, Peers, and Perceptions cookstove study in northern Ghana. Measurements of temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, and carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide concentrations made at 1-min temporal resolution were integrated with 1-min particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) measurements from the HAPEx, within 62 kitchens, across urban and rural households and four seasons totaling 71 48-h deployments. Gravimetric filter sampling was undertaken to ground-truth and evaluate the low-cost measurements. HAPEx baseline drift and relative humidity corrections were investigated and evaluated using signals from paired HAPEx, finding significant improvements. Resulting particle coefficients and integrated gravimetric PM2.5 concentrations were modeled to explore drivers of variability; urban/rural, season, kitchen characteristics, and dust (a major PM2.5 mass constituent) were significant predictors. The high correlation (R2 = 0.79) between 48-h mean HAPEx readings and gravimetric PM2.5 mass (including other covariates) indicates that the HAPEx can be a useful tool in household energy studies.},

Black carbon (BC) is a useful marker of inefficient combustion-related particles; however, ambient air quality data and temporal patterns of personal exposure to BC in SSA are scarce. We measured ambient elemental carbon (EC), comparable to BC, and personal exposure to BC in women of childbearing age from a semi-rural area of southern Mozambique. We measured ambient EC over one year (2014–2015) using a high-volume sampler and an off-line thermo-optical-transmission method. We simultaneously measured 5-min resolved 24-h personal BC using a portable MicroAeth (AE51) in 202 women. We used backwards stepwise linear regression to identify predictors of log-transformed 24-h mean and peak (90th percentile) personal BC exposure. We analyzed data from 187 non-smoking women aged 16–46 years. While daily mean ambient EC reached moderate levels (0.9 μg/m3, Standard Deviation, SD: 0.6 μg/m3), daily mean personal BC reached high levels (15 μg/m3, SD: 19 μg/m3). Daily patterns of personal exposure revealed a peak between 6 and 7 pm ({\textgreater}35 μg/m3), attributable to kerosene-based lighting. Key determinants of mean and peak personal exposure to BC were lighting source, kitchen type, ambient EC levels, and temperature. This study highlights the important contribution of lighting sources to personal exposure to combustion particles in populations that lack access to clean household energy.},

Despite the variability in PM characteristics, which are believed to influence human health risks, the observed relative health risk estimates per unit PM mass falls within a narrow range of values. Furthermore, no single chemical species appears to dominate health effects; rather the effects appear to be due to a combination of species. Non-PM factors such as socioeconomic status and lifestyle are also believed to affect the health risk, although accounting for these confounding factors is challenging. Airborne PM is also responsible for a number of effects aside from human health, such as alterations in visibility and climate. Because the PM problem is associated with a range of societal issues such as energy production and economic development, making progress on reducing the effects of PM will require integrated strategies that bring together scientists and decision makers from different disciplines to consider tradeoffs holistically.},

	abstract = {Increases in tropospheric ozone (O3) abundance are likely to take place in the near future in the populous and rapidly developing countries in the tropics and subtropics. An accurate evaluation of the future impact of increasing industrial activities in tropical and subtropical areas requires knowledge of the background levels of ozone. New ozone monitoring stations have been installed at several sites by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) since the mid201090s. We analyze ozone data collected during two years since April 1996 at Cerro Tololo (30°S, 70°W, 2200 m.a.s.l.) some 50 km east from the city of La Serena. In this paper, we describe some of the atmospheric chemistry and meteorology that characterizes the Tololo site. The data show a seasonal variation with maximum mixing ratios in late winter and spring and minimum mixing ratios in late summer and early fall. These variations are most likely associated with the large2010scale subsidence of the Hadley circulation and the location of the subtropical jet stream (STJ). Also, there is a diurnal variation that is probably partly associated with a mountain wind flow which is strongest in late spring and summer months. No significant mixing with marine boundary layer air perturbed by anthropogenic activities is apparent from the data. We find the Cerro Tololo site to be generally representative for background conditions of free2010tropospheric air in the subtropics of the Southern Hemisphere. This work is done within the framework of a larger effort recently started by several Chilean institutions in cooperation with research centers abroad.},

	abstract = {The optical absorption coefficient, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter {\textless}2.5 microm, and elemental carbon (EC) have been measured simultaneously during winter and spring of 2000 in the western part of Santiago, Chile (Pudahuel district). The optical measurements were carried out with a low-cost instrument recently developed at the University of Santiago. From the data, a site-specific mass absorption coefficient of 4.45+/-0.01 m2/g has been found for EC. In addition, a mass absorption coefficient of 1.02+/-0.03 m2/g has been obtained for PM2.5. These coefficients can be used during the colder months (May-August) to obtain EC concentration or PM2.5 from a measurement of the light absorption coefficient (sigmaa). The high correlation that has been found between these variables indicates that sigmaa is a good indicator of the degree of contamination of urbanized areas. The data also show an increase in PM2.5 and EC concentration during winter and an increase in the ratio of EC to PM2.5. When the EC/PM2.5 ratio is calculated during rush hour (7:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m.) and during part of the night (9:00 p.m.-2:00 a.m.), it is found that the increase is caused by higher concentration levels of EC at night. These results suggest that the rise in the EC concentration is caused by emissions from heating and air mass transport of pollution from other parts of the city, while traffic contribution remains approximately constant.},

Emission estimation based on total miles traveled or other average factors is a sufficient approach only for extended areas such as national or worldwide areas. For road emission control and strategies design, microscale analysis based on real-world emission estimations is often required. This involves actual driving behavior and emission factors of the local vehicle fleet under study. This paper reports on a microscale model for hot road emissions and its application to the metropolitan region of the city of Santiago, Chile. The methodology considers the street-by-street hot emission estimation with its temporal and spatial distribution. The input data come from experimental emission factors based on local driving patterns and traffic surveys of traffic flows for different vehicle categories. The methodology developed is able to estimate hourly hot road CO, total unburned hydrocarbons (THCs), particulate matter (PM), and NO(x) emissions for predefined day types and vehicle categories.},

	abstract = {The emission factors of a bus fleet consisting of approximately 300 diesel-powered buses were measured in a tunnel study under well-controlled conditions during a 2-d monitoring campaign in Brisbane. Particle number and mass concentration levels of submicrometer particles and PM2.5 were monitored by SMPS and DustTrak instruments at the tunnel's entrance and exit, respectively. Correlation between DustTrak and TEOM response to diesel emissions was assessed, and the DustTrak results were recalculated into TEOM equivalent data. The mean value of the number and mass emission factors was (3.11+/-2.41) x 10(14) particles km(-1) for submicrometer particles and 583+/-451 mg km(-1) for PM2.5 (DustTrak), respectively. TEOM PM2.5 equivalent emission factor was 267+/-207 mg km(-1). The results are in good agreement with the emission factors determined from steady-state dynamometer testing of 12 buses from the same Brisbane City bus fleet. The results indicate that when carefully designed, both approaches, the dynamometer and on-road studies, can provide comparable results, applicable for the assessment of the effect of traffic emissions on airborne particle pollution. A brief overview of emission factors determined from other on-road and dynamometer studies reported in the literature as well as with the regulatory values used for the vehicle emission inventory assessment is presented and compared with the results obtained in this study.},

	abstract = {The multi log-normal distribution function is widely in use to parameterize the aerosol particle size distributions. The main purpose of such a parameterization is to quantitatively describe size distributions and to allow straightforward comparisons between different aerosol particle data sets. In this study, we developed and evaluated an algorithm to parameterize aerosol particle number size distributions with the multi log-normal distribution function. The current algorithm is automatic and does not need a user decision for the initial input parameters; it requires only the maximum number of possible modes and then it reduces this number, if possible, without affecting the fitting quality. The reduction of the number of modes is based on an overlapping test between adjacent modes. The algorithm was evaluated against a previous algorithm that can be considered as a standard procedure. It was also evaluated against a long-term data set and different types of measured aerosol particle size distributions in the ambient atmosphere. The evaluation of the current algorithm showed the following advantages: (I) it is suitable for different types of aerosol particles observed in different environments and conditions, (2) it showed agreement with the previous standard algorithm in about 90\% of long-term data set, (3) it is not time-consuming, particularly when long-term data sets are analyzed, and (4) it is a useful tool in the studies of atmospheric aerosol particle formation and transformation.},

An analysis of the influence of fuel inlet technology, and a year time-length model over emissions, was undertaken. We proposed emission factors as a function of average speed and of CO, THC, and NOx for catalytic and noncatalytic light-duty gasoline vehicles, disaggregated on commercial and private cars. A comparative analysis with emission factors obtained for the application of the COPERT II and AP-42 models was also presented. Our current analysis gives solid evidence indicating that to obtain a reasonable accuracy on emission estimates and calculations, local emission factors must be used.},

We tested the hypothesis that inhalation of carbon UFPs has vascular effects in healthy and asthmatic subjects, detectable as alterations in blood leukocyte expression of adhesion molecules. Healthy subjects inhaled filtered air and freshly generated elemental carbon particles (count median diameter approximately 25nm, geometric standard deviation approximately 1.6), for 2 hr, in three separate protocols: 10 microg/m3 at rest, 10 and 25 microg/m3 with exercise, and 50 microg/m3 with exercise. In a fourth protocol, subjects with asthma inhaled air and 10 microg/m3 UFPs with exercise. Peripheral venous blood was obtained before and at intervals after exposure, and leukocyte expression of surface markers was quantitated using multiparameter flow cytometry. In healthy subjects, particle exposure with exercise reduced expression of adhesion molecules CD54 and CD18 on monocytes and CD18 and CD49d on granulocytes. There were also concentration-related reductions in blood monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and increased lymphocyte expression of the activation marker CD25. In subjects with asthma, exposure with exercise to 10 microg/m3 UFPs reduced expression of CD11b on monocytes and eosinophils and CD54 on granulocytes. Particle exposure also reduced the percentage of CD4+ T cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Inhalation of elemental carbon UFPs alters peripheral blood leukocyte distribution and expression of adhesion molecules, in a pattern consistent with increased retention of leukocytes in the pulmonary vascular bed.},

	abstract = {The effective density of fine particles emitted from small-scale wood combustion of various fuels were determined with a system consisting of an aerosol particle mass analyzer and a scanning mobility particle sizer (APM-SMPS). A novel sampling chamber was combined to the system to enable measurements of highly fluctuating combustion processes. In addition, mass-mobility exponents (relates mass and mobility size) were determined from the density data to describe the shape of the particles. Particle size, type of fuel, combustion phase, and combustion conditions were found to have an effect on the effective density and the particle shape. For example, steady combustion phase produced agglomerates with effective density of roughly 1 g cm?3 for small particles, decreasing to 0.25 g cm?3 for 400 nm particles. The effective density was higher for particles emitted from glowing embers phase (ca. 1?2 g cm?3), and a clear size dependency was not observed as the particles were nearly spherical in shape. This study shows that a single value cannot be used for the effective density of particles emitted from wood combustion.},

	abstract = {Active and Agile Environmental and Biological sensing are becoming obligatory to generate prompt warnings for
the troops and law enforcements conducting missions in hostile environments. The traditional static sensing mesh
networks which provide a coarse-grained (far-field) measurement of the environmental conditions like air quality,
radiation , CO2, etc … would not serve the dynamic and localized changes in the environment, which requires a
fine-grained (near-field) sensing solutions. Further, sensing the biological conditions of (healthy and injured)
personnel in a contaminated environment and providing a personalized analysis of the life-threatening conditions in
real-time would greatly aid the success of the mission. In this vein, under SATE and YATE programs, the research
team at AFRL Tec{\textasciicircum}Edge Discovery labs had demonstrated the feasibility of developing Smartphone applications ,
that employ a suite of external environmental and biological sensors, which provide fine-grained and customized
sensing in real-time fashion. In its current state, these smartphone applications leverage a custom designed modular
standalone embedded platform (with external sensors) that can be integrated seamlessly with Smartphones for
sensing and further provides connectivity to a back-end data architecture for archiving, analysis and dissemination
of real-time alerts. Additionally, the developed smartphone applications have been successfully tested in the field
with varied environmental sensors to sense humidity, CO2/CO, wind, etc…, ; and with varied biological sensors to
sense body temperature and pulse with apt real-time analysis},

Vast regions in Asia that include {\textgreater} 80\% of the population have PM2.5 concentrations that exceed on an annual basis the WHO guideline of 10 microg/m3, often by factors of 2 to 4. These high aerosol loadings also have important radiative effects, causing a significant dimming at the surface, and mask approximately 45\% of the warming by greenhouse gases. Black carbon (BC) concentrations are high throughout Asia, representing 5-10\% of the total AOD, and contributing significantly to atmospheric warming (its warming potential is approximately 55\% of that due to CO2). PM levels and AODs in year 2030, estimated based on simulations that consider future changes in emissions, are used to explore opportunities for win-win strategies built upon addressing air quality and climate change together. It is found that in 2030 the PM2.5 levels in significant parts of Asia will increase and exacerbate health impacts; but the aerosols will have a larger masking effect on radiative forcing, due to a decrease in BC and an increase in SO2 emissions.},

We investigated the associations of the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 and their elemental components for elderly clinic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in two cities with different PM compositions, that is, New York City (NYC) and Seattle. Daily measurements of CMS, outdoor residential, and indoor PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, as well as personal PM10, were made concurrently for 12-consecutive winter days at 9 NYC and 15 Seattle residences, as well for 9 NYC residences in summer. Filters were analyzed for elemental components using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and for black carbon (BC) by light reflectance, and outdoor–indoor–personal relationships of PM components were examined using mixed-effect models. Using sulfur (S) as a tracer of PM of ambient origin, the mean contributions of outdoor PM2.5 was 55.2\% of the indoor concentrations in NYC, and 80.0\% in Seattle, and outdoor PM2.5 in NYC and Seattle were 19.7 and 18.5\% of personal PM2.5 concentration. S was distributed homogeneously in both cities (R2=0.65), whereas nickel (R2=0.23) was much more spatially heterogeneous. Thus, CMS measurements can adequately reflect personal exposures for spatially uniform components, such as sulfate, but they are not adequate for components from more local sources.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Recent epidemiological studies have shown an association between increased particulate urban air pollution and adverse health effects on susceptible parts of the population, in particular the elderly with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Urban particles consist of three modes: ultrafine particles, accumulation mode particles (which together form the fine particle mode) and coarse mode particles. Ultrafine particles (those of {\textless} 0.1 micron diameter) contribute very little to the overall mass, but are very high in number, which in episodic events can reach several hundred thousand/cm3 in the urban air. The hypothesis that ultrafine particles are causally involved in adverse responses seen in sensitive humans is based on several studies summarized in this brief review. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies on rodents demonstrate that ultrafine particles administered to the lung cause a greater inflammatory response than do larger particles, per given mass. Surface properties (surface chemistry) appear to play an important role in ultrafine particle toxicity. Contributing to the effects of ultrafine particles is their very high size-specific deposition when inhaled as singlet ultrafine particles rather than as aggregated particles. It appears also that ultrafine particles, after deposition in the lung, largely escape alveolar macrophage surveillance and gain access to the pulmonary interstitium. Inhaled low doses of carbonaceous ultrafine particles can cause mild pulmonary inflammation in rodents after exposure for 6 h. Old age and a compromised/sensitized respiratory tract in rodents can increase their susceptibility to the inflammatory effects of ultrafine particles significantly, and it appears that the aged organism is at a higher risk of oxidative stress induced lung injury from these particles, compared with the young organism. Results also show that ultrafine particle effects can be significantly enhanced by a gaseous co-pollutant such as ozone. CONCLUSIONS: The studies performed so far support the ultrafine particle hypothesis. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate mechanistic pathways of responses.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16382934},
	abstract = {The database on particle number emission factors has been very limited to date despite the increasing interest in the effects of human exposure to particles in the submicrometer range. There are also major questions on the comparability of emission factors derived through dynamometer versus on-road studies. Thus, the aims of this study were (1) to quantify vehicle number emission factors in the submicrometer (and also supermicrometer) range for stop-start and free-flowing traffic at about 100 km h(-1) driving conditions through extensive road measurements and (2) to compare the emission factors from the road measurements with those obtained previously from dynamometer studies conducted in Brisbane. For submicrometer particles the average emission factors for Tora Street were estimated at (1.89 +/- 3.40) x 10(13) particles km(-1) (mean +/- standard error; n = 386) for petrol and (7.17 +/- 2.80) x 10(14) particles km(-1) (diesel; n = 196) and for supermicrometer particles at 2.59 x 10(9) particles km(-1) and 1.53 x 10(12) particles km(-1), respectively. The average number emission factors for submicrometer particles estimated for Ipswich Road (stop-start traffic mode) were (2.18 +/- 0.57) x 10(13) particles km(-1) (petrol) and (2.04 +/- 0.24) x 10(14) particles km(-1) (diesel). One implication of the conclusion that emission factors of heavy duty diesel vehicles are over 1 order of magnitude higher than emission factors of petrol-fueled passenger cars is that future control and management strategies should in particular target heavy duty vehicles, as even a moderate decrease in emissions of these vehicles would have a significant impact on lowering atmospheric concentrations of particles. The finding that particle number emissions per vehicle-km are significantly larger for higher speed vehicle operation has an important implication on urban traffic planning and optimization of vehicle speed to lower their impact on airborne pollution. Additionally, statistical analysis showed that neither the measuring method (dynamometer or on-road), nor data origin (Brisbane or elsewhere in the world), is associated with a statistically significant difference between the average values of emission factors for diesel, petrol, and vehicle fleet mix. However, statistical analyses of the effect of fuel showed that the mean values of emission factors for petrol and diesel are different at a 5\% significance level.},

	abstract = {Road emissions are one of the most important sources of primary air pollutants in the industrialized world. Here we describe the emission factors of road traffic derived from measurements in the Gubrist tunnel (near Zürich, Switzerland). The measurements performed from 20 to 26 September 1993, included a large variety of compounds and detailed traffic information. Multiple regression models have been used to calculate the emission factors of NOx, CO, total hydrocarbon (t-HC) and 26 individual hydrocarbons. Three types of vehicle classifications (light duty and heavy duty vehicles, gasoline and diesel powered vehicles and a refined version of the latter classification) and two approaches for modelling the influence of average vehicle speed (approximately 80 to 100 km/h) lead to five different statistical models. A further model was developed for the description of the dependence of the relative composition of organic exhaust gases on average vehicle speed. This dependence was found to be weak but statistically significant for several compounds. This paper describes why and how refinements of simpler models were developed. If calculated emission factors are to be compared with results of other studies, several models may be needed. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Until now, devices incorporating such sensors have been tested primarily for their technical capabilities and limitations, whereas their usability and acceptability amongst the public rarely goes beyond proof of concept, leaving user experience (UX) unstudied. The authors argue that UX should be taken into account to make sure that products and services are fit for purpose. Nineteen volunteers tested and evaluated a prototype device and provided feedback through semi-structured interviews and during focus group sessions. Their UX was then coded using mixed coding methods regarding device functionality and recommendations for future product development. The results indicate that UX can identify potentially problematic design aspects while giving deeper insights into user needs. For example, UX recognized that one of the most important aspects of user involvement and motivation was successful data harvesting, which frequently failed. This study recommends that future developers of low-cost portable air quality sensor systems prioritize reliable data transmission to minimize data loss. This will ensure an efficient and positive UX that supports user engagement in citizen science based research where collecting sensor-based data is the primary objective.},

	abstract = {Data are essential in all areas of geophysics. They are used to better understand and manage systems, either directly or via models. Given the complexity and spatiotemporal variability of geophysical systems (e.g., precipitation), a lack of sufficient data is a perennial problem, which is exacerbated by various drivers, such as climate change and urbanization. In recent years, crowdsourcing has become increasingly prominent as a means of supplementing data obtained from more traditional sources, particularly due to its relatively low implementation cost and ability to increase the spatial and/or temporal resolution of data significantly. Given the proliferation of different crowdsourcing methods in geophysics and the promise they have shown, it is timely to assess the state-of-the-art in this field, to identify potential issues and map out a way forward. In this paper, crowdsourcing-based data acquisition methods that have been used in seven domains of geophysics, including weather, precipitation, air pollution, geography, ecology, surface water and natural hazard management are discussed based on a review of 162 papers. In addition, a novel framework for categorizing these methods is introduced and applied to the methods used in the seven domains of geophysics considered in this review. This paper also features a review of 93 papers dealing with issues that are common to data acquisition methods in different domains of geophysics, including the management of crowdsourcing projects, data quality, data processing and data privacy. In each of these areas, the current status is discussed and challenges and future directions are outlined.},

	abstract = {Background
Lower-cost air quality sensors (hundreds to thousands of dollars) are now available to individuals and communities. This technology is undergoing a rapid and fragmented evolution, resulting in sensors that have uncertain data quality, measure different air pollutants and possess a variety of design attributes. Why and how individuals and communities choose to use sensors is arguably influenced by social context. For example, community experiences with environmental exposures and health effects and related interactions with industry and government can affect trust in traditional air quality monitoring. To date, little social science research has been conducted to evaluate why or how sensors, and sensor data, are used by individuals and communities, or how the introduction of sensors changes the relationship between communities and air quality managers.
Objectives
This commentary uses a risk governance/responsible innovation framework to identify opportunities for interdisciplinary research that brings together social scientists with air quality researchers involved in developing, testing, and deploying sensors in communities.
Discussion
Potential areas for social science research include communities of sensor users; drivers for use of sensors and sensor data; behavioral, socio-political, and ethical implications of introducing sensors into communities; assessing methods for communicating sensor data; and harnessing crowdsourcing capabilities to analyze sensor data.
Conclusions
Social sciences can enhance understanding of perceptions, attitudes, behaviors, and other human factors that drive levels of engagement with and trust in different types of air quality data. New transdisciplinary research bridging social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, and design fields of study, and involving citizen scientists working with professionals from a variety of backgrounds, can increase our understanding of air sensor technology use and its impacts on air quality and public health.},

	abstract = {Air pollution, in particular due to particulate matter, is considered a critical issue, and it is receiving ever growing attention. Environmental monitoring is not limited to the outdoor case in crowded cities, but it is also usefully applied to indoor cases such as factories and offices, or in indoor/outdoor mixed case, such as construction sites or in general industrial plants. This paper describes the case study of an environmental monitoring system, which is compliant with Internet of Things domain. In particular it is suitable for indoor/outdoor industrial applications focused on Particulate Matter measurements. In order to create a reference model, a PM10/PM2.5 sensor not yet tested in literature is used, the Honeywell HPMA115S0-XXX. Four PM10/PM2.5 sensors are used together to test repeatability. This device turned out to be effective in esteeming the level of pollution using low cost sensors, as an alternative to expensive and not portable professional devices. The implementation proposed in this paper is able to give high R values of linear regression, guaranteeing at the same time low cost in terms of hardware and low power consumption.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, there is a great pressure on finding an alternative source of energy. One of such sources is biomass combustion. Biomass is any organic matter such as: wood, crops, seaweed and animal wastes which during combustion emits energy but also smoke and solid residue. Biomass burning tracers, such as levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan, are sugar anhydrides which are produced during burning of biomass containing cellulose and hemicellulose. Analysis of environmental samples for tracers is the source of information about the type of biofuel burned. In this article, a literature review of preparation and determination of biomass burning tracers for environmental samples was presented. The review discusses the preparation of different samples (particulate matter, soils, sediments, biological samples), extraction, derivatization and determination. Amongst determination methods the most popular was gas chromatography with mass spectrometry but other techniques were also used, such as: high performance liquid chromatography with aerosol charge detection, capillary electrophoresis with pulsed amperometric detection and ion chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection.

	abstract = {Air pollution in north China is still severe, although Chinese government has exerted great efforts to cut down pollutant emissions in the past decade. To understand the chemistry and sources of the haze particles in north China, PM2.5 aerosols were collected in Beijing from January 7 to February 27, 2014, during which two haze episodes (haze I and haze II) occurred. The samples were analyzed for water soluble inorganic ions, trace elements, sugars, n-alkane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fatty acids, dicarboxylic acid, EC (elemental carbon) and OC (organic carbon). Our results showed that relative abundances of primary species such as sugars, PAHs and EC were more abundant on the clean days and the haze I period in Beijing, while secondary aerosols especially secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA)were more abundant in the haze II period. Source apportionment further showed that emissions from cooking (21.6\%), road-dust (19.4\%), coal combustion (17.8\%) and biomass burning (15.4\%) were the main sources of PM2.5 during the clean days, while biomass burning (20.1\%) and coal combustion (17.1\%) were the main sources during haze I period. For the haze II period, vehicle exhausts (26.9\%), secondary aerosol formation (26.6\%) and industrial emission (19.1\%) were the dominant sources of PM2.5. Our work suggests that it is indispensable to reduce the emissions from biomass burning and vehicle exhaust in Beijing in order to further mitigate the haze pollution.},

	abstract = {Through the use of monitoring, modeling, and emission inventories, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has identified residential wood combustion (RWC) as a significant source of air pollution in Oregon. Detailed emission inventories provide the best source of information to inform pollution reduction strategies. In order to refine and improve state and local RWC emission inventories, DEQ contracted with the Portland State University Survey Research Lab to perform a telephone survey on RWC in the Portland metro area. The goal of the project was to 1) quantify these emissions by type and location, and 2) to spatially allocate these emissions to US Census blocks in the study area and other parts of the state. Results, based on 1061 residences surveyed, showed that 4.3\% of respondents burned wood for primary heating and 17.8\% burned wood for secondary (backup heating or aesthetics) purposes. Primary burners burned four times more wood on average per device than secondary burners. As such, even though there were fewer primary burners they burned 51\% of the total wood fuel combusted. The breakdown of estimated emissions of particulate matter 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) from primary and secondary burners is nearly even, with 46.5\% of emissions coming from primary burning and 53.5\% of emissions coming from secondary burning. Uncertified woodstoves and inserts are the source of just over half (50.5\%) the emissions in the Survey area, followed by emissions from certified woodstoves and inserts (26.3\%), fireplaces (21.5\%), pellet stoves (0.9\%), and fire-log burning (0.8\%). Survey results for burning activity and housing type showed good correlation, and were mapped to US Census housing data (units in structure) for block-groups. The Survey results also showed differences in burning behavior between urban/suburban and rural areas. This distinction coupled with housing types provided a method of spatial allocation for RWC activity and emissions that could be a useful tool for other states and regions.},

	abstract = {In Paraguay, 49\% of the population depends on biomass (wood and charcoal) for cooking. Residential biomass burning is a major source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) in and around the household environment. In July 2016, cross-sectional household air pollution sampling was conducted in 80 households in rural Paraguay. Time-integrated samples (24-h) of PM2.5 and continuous CO concentrations were measured in kitchens that used wood, charcoal, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or electricity to cook. Qualitative and quantitative household-level variables were captured using questionnaires. The average PM2.5 concentration (μg/m3) was higher in kitchens that burned wood (741.7 ± 546.4) and charcoal (107.0 ± 68.6) than in kitchens where LPG (52.3 ± 18.9) or electricity (52.0 ± 14.8) were used. Likewise, the average CO concentration (ppm) was higher in kitchens that used wood (19.4 ± 12.6) and charcoal (7.6 ± 6.5) than in those that used LPG (0.5 ± 0.6) or electricity (0.4 ± 0.6). Multivariable linear regression was conducted to generate predictive models for indoor PM2.5 and CO concentrations (predicted R2 = 0.837 and 0.822, respectively). This study provides baseline indoor air quality data for Paraguay and presents a multivariate statistical approach that could be used in future research and intervention programs.

At the first level, sensing nodes collect and send data to the second level, consisting of fog nodes. The fog nodes pre-process and deliver data to the third level, the cloud infrastructure, which stores and makes data externally available. The fog infrastructure, on the other hand, discards defective data, compresses information, and provides secure access points between fog and cloud. To validate SensingBus, we build a prototype and perform experiments to stress the fog nodes. We verify that each one can accommodate at least 20 simultaneous sensing nodes, an adequate number to sense a city such as Rio de Janeiro.},

	abstract = {Air pollution exposure characterization has been shaped by many constraints. These include technologies that lead to insufficient coverage across space and/or time in order to characterize individual or community-level exposures with sufficient accuracy and precision. However, there is now capacity for continuous monitoring of many air pollutants using comparatively inexpensive, real-time sensors. Crucial questions remain regarding whether or not these sensors perform adequately for various potential end uses and whether performance varies over time or across ambient conditions. Performance scrutiny of sensors via lab- and field-testing and calibration across their lifetime is necessary for interpretation of data, and has important implications for end users including cost effectiveness and ease of use. We developed a comparatively lower-cost, portable, in-home air sampling platform and a guiding development and maintenance workflow that achieved our goal of characterizing some key indoor pollutants with high sensitivity and reasonable accuracy. Here we describe the process of selecting, validating, calibrating, and maintaining our platform – the Environmental Multi-pollutant Monitoring Assembly (EMMA) – over the course of our study to-date. We highlight necessary resources and consider implications for communities or researchers interested in developing such platforms, focusing on PM2.5, NO, and NO2 sensors. Our findings emphasize that lower-cost sensors should be deployed with caution, given financial and resource costs that greatly exceed sensor costs, but that selected community objectives could be supported at lesser cost and community-based participatory research strategies could be used for more wide-ranging goals.},

MegaSense involves a novel hierarchy of multi-vendor distributed air quality sensors, in which accurate sensors calibrate lower cost sensors. Current low-cost air quality sensors suffer from measurement drift and they have low accuracy. We address this significant open problem for dense urban areas by developing a calibration scheme that detects and automatically corrects drift. MegaSense integrates with the 5G cellular network and leverages mobile edge computing for sensor management and distributed pollution map creation. We demonstrate MegaSense with two sensor types, a state of the art air quality monitoring station and a low-cost sensor array, with calibration between the two to improve the accuracy of the low-cost device. Participants can interact with the sensors and see air quality changes in real-time, and observe the mechanism to mitigate sensor drift. Our re-calibration method minimizes the error for NO2 and O3 81\% of the time (vs single calibration) and reduces the mean relative error by 25\%-45\%.},

Urban particulate matter air pollution induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) from alveolar macrophages, resulting in an increase in thrombosis. Here, we report that metformin provides protection in this murine model. Treatment of mice with metformin or exposure of murine or human alveolar macrophages to metformin prevented the particulate matter-induced generation of complex III mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which were necessary for the opening of calcium release-activated channels (CRAC) and release of IL-6. Targeted genetic deletion of electron transport or CRAC channels in alveolar macrophages in mice prevented particulate matter-induced acceleration of arterial thrombosis. These findings suggest metformin as a potential therapy to prevent some of the premature deaths attributable to air pollution exposure worldwide.},

	abstract = {Background
Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO) represents the confluence of bronchial airway hyper reactivity and chronic airflow limitation and has been described as leading to worse lung function and quality of life than found with either singular disease process.
Objective
We aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors for ACO among adults across six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Methods
We compiled cross-sectional data for 11,923 participants aged 35-92 years from four population-based studies in 12 settings. We defined COPD as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC below the lower limit of normal, asthma as wheeze or medication use in 12 months or self-reported physician diagnosis, and ACO as having both.
Results
The prevalence of ACO was 3.8\% (0\% in rural Puno, Peru to 7.8\% in Matlab, Bangladesh). The odds of having ACO were higher with household exposure to biomass fuel smoke (OR=1.48; 95\% CI 0.98–2.23), smoking (OR=1.28 per 10 pack-years; 1.22–1.34), and having primary or less education (OR=1.35; 1.07–1.70) compared to non-obstructed individuals. ACO was associated with severe breathing obstruction (FEV1 \% predicted {\textless}50; 31.5\% of ACO vs. 10.9\% of COPD alone or 3.5\% of asthma alone) and severe spirometric deficits compared to participants with asthma (-1.61 z scores FEV1; -1.48, -1.75) or COPD alone (-0.94 z scores; -0.78, -1.10).
Conclusion
ACO may be as prevalent and more severe in LMICs than has been reported in high-income settings. Exposure to biomass fuel smoke may be an overlooked risk factor and we favor diagnostic criteria for ACO that include environmental exposures common to LMICs.},

Projecting the drivers (e.g., technical, economic, societal, regulatory) that will impact future emissions is challenging, and assessing regional air quality (AQ) is complicated by the need for detailed modeling tools and data inputs to simulate chemistry and transport of pollutants. This work assesses the contribution of emissions from transportation sources to ground-level concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter via two methods. First, impacts are quantified for three U.S. regions including California using output from an economic optimization model to grow a base year emissions inventory to 2055. Second, impacts are considered for California using state-level projections with an updated emissions inventory and modeling suite in 2035. For both, advanced AQ models are used, showing that the impacts of light duty vehicles are moderate, reflecting shifts to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. In contrast, heavy duty vehicles, ships, and off-road equipment are associated with important ozone and PM2.5 burdens. Emissions from petroleum fuel production and distribution activities also have notable impacts on ozone and PM2.5. These transportation sub-sectors should be the focus of future emissions reduction policies.},

In addition to researching emission measurement techniques, this program aimed to foster international partnerships and provide students with a hands-on educational experience, culminating in a pilot study in India. Before traveling, students from Duke and IIT met virtually to design experiments. IIT students were able to visit proposed sites and offer specified knowledge on burning practices prior to the pilot study, allowing potential experiments to be iteratively improved. The results demonstrated a proof of concept of using a low-cost sensor attached to a commercial drone to measure emissions from a municipal dump site. In addition, for small-scale residential and roadside trash burning, a combustor was designed to burn trash in a consistent way. Results suggested that thermocouples and low-cost sensors may offer an affordable way for combustor designers to assess particulate emissions during prototype iterations. More experiences like this should be made available so that future research can benefit from the unique insights that come from having veteran researchers work with students and from forming international partnerships.},

	abstract = {In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the electricity grid in Puerto Rico was devastated, with over 90\% of the island without electricity; as of December 2017, about 50\% of the island lacked electricity, and power outages were common elsewhere. Backup generators were widely used, sometimes as the main source of electricity. The hurricane also damaged the island’s existing air monitoring network and the University of Puerto Rico’s observing facilities. We deployed four lower-cost air quality monitors (Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant or RAMP monitors) and a black carbon (BC) monitor in the San Juan Metro Area in November 2017. The first month of data collected with the RAMPs showed high sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations of varying magnitudes each night. SO2 and CO are strongly correlated (r2 {\textgreater}0.9) at two sites {\textasciitilde}5 km apart (University of Puerto Rico and an industrial area, Puerto Nuevo), suggesting a single source type. BC measured at the UPR site is also well correlated with CO and SO2. While the RAMPs are not certified as a federal equivalent method, the RAMP SO2 data suggest that the EPA’s daily 1-hour threshold for SO2 (75 ppb) was exceeded on almost 80\% of the first 30 days of deployment (November-December 2017). The widespread reliance on generators for regular electric supply in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria appears to have increased air pollution in San Juan.},

People believe that air pollution is an outside urban phenomenon, but some of the uppermost concentration occurs in the opposite situation i.e., countryside and in the house. Such levels are due to the high proportion of countryside/less developed countries population relies on unprocessed biomass fuels (like wood, crop residues, dung) which have high pollutant emission factors, in simple small scale burning devices such as household cooking. Domestic cooking is one among the major activities of the rural Indian house wives. Cooking is carried out in an enclosed space with poor ventilation and inefficient stoves. Long duration of exposure to biomass fuel mostly affects women, young girls and children. In most of the developing countries biomass fuel is used for cooking. Girls start cooking at very early age and spend minimum 4-6 hours daily in kitchen for almost 30-40 years which is equivalent to 60,000 hours of exposure. Indoor air pollution occurs primarily by usage of biomass fuels which attributes 1.5-2 million deaths/year.},

	abstract = {As COVID-19 swept across the globe, increased ventilation and implementation of air cleaning were emphasized by the US CDC and WHO as important strategies to reduce the risk of inhalation exposure to the virus. To assess whether higher ventilation and air cleaning rates lead to lower exposure risk to SARS-CoV-2, 1274 manuscripts published between April 2020 and September 2022 were screened using key words “airborne SARS-CoV-2 or “SARS-CoV-2 aerosol.” Ninety-three studies involved air sampling at locations with known sources (hospitals and residences) were selected and associated data were compiled. Two metrics were used to assess exposure risk: SARS-CoV-2 concentration and SARS-CoV-2 detection rate in air samples. Locations were categorized by type (hospital or residence) and proximity to the location housing the isolated/quarantined patient (primary or secondary). The results showed that hospital wards had lower airborne virus concentrations than residential isolation rooms. A negative correlation was found between airborne virus concentrations in primary-occupancy areas and air changes per hour (ACH). In hospital settings, sample positivity rates were significantly reduced in secondary-occupancy areas compared to primary-occupancy areas, but they were similar across sampling locations in residential settings. ACH and sample positivity rates were negatively correlated, though the effect was diminished when ACH values exceeded 8. While limitations associated with diverse sampling protocols exist, data considered by this meta-analysis support the notion that higher ACH may reduce exposure risks to the virus in ambient air.

	abstract = {Understanding the airborne survival of viruses is important for public health and epidemiological modeling and potentially to develop mitigation strategies to minimize the transmission of airborne pathogens. Laboratory experiments typically involve investigating the effects of environmental parameters on the viability or infectivity of a target airborne virus. However, conflicting results among studies are common. Herein, the results of 34 aerovirology studies were compared to identify links between environmental and compositional effects on the viability of airborne viruses. While the specific experimental apparatus was not a factor in variability between reported results, it was determined that the experimental procedure was a major factor that contributed to discrepancies in results. The most significant contributor to variability between studies was poorly defined initial viable virus concentration in the aerosol phase, causing many studies to not measure the rapid inactivation, which occurs quickly after particle generation, leading to conflicting results. Consistently, studies that measured their reference airborne viability minutes after aerosolization reported higher viability at subsequent times, which indicates that there is an initial loss of viability which is not captured in these studies. The composition of the particles which carry the viruses was also found to be important in the viability of airborne viruses; however, the mechanisms for this effect are unknown. Temperature was found to be important for aerosol-phase viability, but there is a lack of experiments that directly compare the effects of temperature in the aerosol phase and the bulk phase. There is a need for repeated measurements between different research groups under identical conditions both to assess the degree of variability between studies and also to attempt to better understand already published data. Lack of experimental standardization has hindered the ability to quantify the differences between studies, for which we provide recommendations for future studies. These recommendations are as follows: measuring the reference airborne viability using the “direct method”; use equipment which maximizes time resolution; quantify all losses appropriately; perform, at least, a 5- and 10-min sample, if possible; report clearly the composition of the virus suspension; measure the composition of the gas throughout the experiment. Implementing these recommendations will address the most significant oversights in the existing literature and produce data which can more easily be quantitatively compared.},

	abstract = {The CNTNAP2 gene, coding for the cell adhesion glycoprotein Caspr2, is thought to be one of the major susceptibility genes for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A large number of rare heterozygous missense CNTNAP2 variants have been identified in ASD patients. However, most of them are inherited from an unaffected parent, questioning their clinical significance. In the present study, we evaluate their impact on neurodevelopmental functions of Caspr2 in a heterozygous genetic background. Performing cortical neuron cultures from mouse embryos, we demonstrate that Caspr2 plays a dose-dependent role in axon growth in vitro. Loss of one Cntnap2 allele is sufficient to elicit axonal growth alteration, revealing a situation that may be relevant for CNTNAP2 heterozygosity in ASD patients. Then, we show that the two ASD variants I869T and G731S, which present impaired binding to Contactin2/TAG-1, do not rescue axonal growth deficits. We find that the variant R1119H leading to protein trafficking defects and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum has a dominant-negative effect on heterozygous Cntnap2 cortical neuron axon growth, through oligomerization with wild-type Caspr2. Finally, we identify an additional variant (N407S) with a dominant-negative effect on axon growth although it is well-localized at the membrane and properly binds to Contactin2. Thus, our data identify a new neurodevelopmental function for Caspr2, the dysregulation of which may contribute to clinical manifestations of ASD, and provide evidence that CNTNAP2 heterozygous missense variants may contribute to pathogenicity in ASD, through selective mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, a large variety of alterations of the Contactin Associated Protein 2 (CNTNAP2) gene, encoding Caspr2, have been identified in several neuronal disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Some of these alterations are homozygous but most are heterozygous, and one of the current challenges is to estimate to what extent they could affect the functions of Caspr2 and contribute to the development of these pathologies. Notably, it is not known whether the disruption of a single CNTNAP2 allele could be sufficient to perturb the functions of Caspr2. To get insights into this issue, we questioned whether Cntnap2 heterozygosity and Cntnap2 null homozygosity in mice could both impact, either similarly or differentially, some specific functions of Caspr2 during development and in adulthood. We focused on yet poorly explored functions of Caspr2 in axon development and myelination, and performed a morphological study from embryonic day E17.5 to adulthood of two major brain interhemispheric myelinated tracts, the anterior commissure (AC) and the corpus callosum (CC), comparing wild-type (WT), Cntnap2–/– and Cntnap2+/– mice. We also looked for myelinated fiber abnormalities in the sciatic nerves of mutant mice. Our work revealed that Caspr2 controls the morphology of the CC and AC throughout development, axon diameter at early developmental stages, cortical neuron intrinsic excitability at the onset of myelination, and axon diameter and myelin thickness at later developmental stages. Changes in axon diameter, myelin thickness and node of Ranvier morphology were also detected in the sciatic nerves of the mutant mice. Importantly, most of the parameters analyzed were affected in Cntnap2+/– mice, either specifically, more severely, or oppositely as compared to Cntnap2–/– mice. In addition, Cntnap2+/– mice, but not Cntnap2–/– mice, showed motor/coordination deficits in the grid-walking test. Thus, our observations show that both Cntnap2 heterozygosity and Cntnap2 null homozygosity impact axon and central and peripheral myelinated fiber development, but in a differential manner. This is a first step indicating that CNTNAP2 alterations could lead to a multiplicity of phenotypes in humans, and raising the need to evaluate the impact of Cntnap2 heterozygosity on the other neurodevelopmental functions of Caspr2.},

heterozygous missense variants have been identified in patients with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). The contribution of these variants to the
manifestations of ASD is however highly controversial because numerous
heterozygous missense variants have also been identified in control subjects. In
a recent study, we set up a sensitive developmental in vitro cell assay to
clarify the potential functional impact of these variants in a heterozygous
Cntnap2 background relevant for CNTNAP2
heterozygosity in patients with ASD. We showed that the cell adhesion
glycoprotein Caspr2 encoded by CNTNAP2 plays a dose-dependent
role in cortical neuron axon growth and provided a proof of principle that some
variants have functional consequences, either a loss of function or a
dominant-negative effect. This indicates that phenotypes mimicking
CNTNAP2 heterozygous and homozygous null mutation may exist
in humans. Our observations further suggest that more variants than originally
expected could be functionally deleterious and induce a high heterogeneity of
phenotypes at the scale of the whole brain. This raises the interesting
possibility that CNTNAP2 heterozygous missense variants could
define an overall endophenotype shaping a risk for ASD and questions whether,
beyond ASD, the variants could contribute to the development of other
neurodevelopmental disorders and/or genetically less complex pathologies.},

Occupancy-aided ventilation methods can effectively improve the airborne infection risk control performance with a sacrifice of decreasing working productivity because of the reduced occupancy. This study evaluates the effectiveness of two occupancy-aided ventilation methods, i.e., the continuously reduced occupancy method and the intermittently reduced occupancy method. The continuously reduced occupancy method is determined by the steady equation of the mass conservation law of the indoor contaminant, and the intermittently reduced occupancy method is determined by a genetic algorithm-based optimization. A two-scenarios-based evaluation framework is developed, i.e., one with targeted airborne infection risk control performance (indicated by the mean rebreathed fraction) and the other with targeted working productivity (indicated by the accumulated occupancy). The results show that the improvement in the airborne infection risk control performance linearly and quadratically increases with the reduction in the working productivity for the continuously reduced occupancy method and the intermittently reduced occupancy method respectively. At a given targeted airborne infection risk control performance, the intermittently reduced occupancy method outperforms the continuously reduced occupancy method by improving the working productivity by up to 92\%. At a given targeted working productivity, the intermittently reduced occupancy method outperforms the continuously reduced occupancy method by improving the airborne infection risk control performance by up to 38\%.},

The evaluation is based on a calibrated whole-building energy model and validated IAQ predictions using field data obtained from a school case study in Jeddah. The results of this research study confirm that hourly and sub-hourly monitoring of indoor CO2 concentration is required to ensure optimal design and operation of the ventilation systems in schools. In addition, the analyses indicate that a 13\% increase in cooling energy end-use can result for any additional 0.1 students/m2 density increase in the classrooms.

We conducted the following real-time field measurements inside buses: CO2, airborne particle concentration, temperature, and relative humidity data during peak and off-peak hours in spring and autumn. Correlation analysis was adopted to evaluate the dominant factors influencing CO2 and particle mass concentrations in the vehicle. The cumulative personal exposure dose to particulate matter and reproduction number were calculated for passengers on a one-way trip. The results showed the in-cabin CO2 concentrations, with 22.11\% and 21.27\% of the total time exceeding 1000 ppm in spring and autumn respectively. In-cabin PM2.5 mass concentration exceeded 35 μm/m3 by 57.35\% and 86.42\% in spring and autumn, respectively. CO2 concentration and the cumulative number of passengers were approximately linearly correlated in both seasons, with R value up to 0.896. The cumulative number of passengers had the most impact on PM2.5 mass concentration among tested parameters. The cumulative personal exposure dose to PM2.5 during a one-way trip in autumn was up to 43.13 μg. The average reproductive number throughout the one-way trip was 0.26; it was 0.57 under the assumed extreme environment.

	abstract = {Children’s health, attendance, and academic performance may be affected by school environmental hazards. While prior studies evaluated home environment and health, few have evaluated indicators of school in-/outdoor environment and health. This study addresses this knowledge gap by systematically reviewing and evaluating outdoor and indoor indicators of school environment and student’s health and performance in New York State (NYS). We also evaluate statistical methodologies to address highly correlated indicators and integrate multiple exposures. Multiple school environmental indicators were identified from various existing NYS datasets. We summarized data sources, completeness, geographic and temporal coverage, and data quality for each indicator. Each indicator was evaluated by scientific basis/relevance, analytic soundness/feasibility, and interpretation/utility, and validated using objective NYS data. Finally, advanced variable selection methods were described and discussed. We have identified and evaluated multiple school environmental health indicators. It was found that mold and moisture problems, ventilation problems, ambient ozone, and PM2.5 levels are among the top priorities of school environmental issues/indicators in NYS, which were also consistent while using NYS data. Choice of best variable selection method should be made based on the research questions and data characteristics. The school environmental health indicators identified, and variable selection methods evaluated, in this study could be used by other researchers to help school officials and policy makers initiate prevention programs.},

	abstract = {Background:
Sick building syndrome (SBS) is defined as a condition occurring in those who live or work in a modern building and who suffer from symptoms such as headache, fatigue, lack of concentration and irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

Objectives:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between personal characteristics, environmental factors and the prevalence of SBS among the secretaries working in a hospital.

Method:
In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were administered to all secretaries who were working in Kütahya hospital in January and March 2018. The questionnaire used in the study included the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants and the question form “MM 040 NA Hospital” to evaluate SBS symptoms. These symptoms were the clinical symptoms reported by the secretaries as a result of exposure to factors within the hospital. Temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity and noise level were measured in the indoor environment of the hospital. Chi square test, Spearman’s correlation coefficient and logistic regression models were used in the analysis of data.

Results:

            The study was completed with 177 people, 61.6\% women, and the mean age was 30.14±5.7. The prevalence of SBS was found to be 20.9\%. The risk of SBS was found to be 2.9 times higher for females, 2.8 times higher for individuals who described the working environment as dusty, 2.6 times higher for subjects complaining of stuffy “bad” air, dry air and an unpleasant odour. All measurements were found to be within acceptable limits. The risk of SBS was found to be 1.2 times higher with increases in the measured noise level, and 2.1 times higher with increased carbon dioxide (CO
            2
            ) concentrations.
          

Conclusion:
The factors impacting the risk of experiencing SBS were determined. Bearing these factors in mind, we think that hospital administrations should be informed about arrangements and measures that will improve the quality of the internal environment of the hospital.},

	abstract = {Background: Multiple SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events suggest that aerosols play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the detailed roles of coarse ({\textgreater}5μm) and fine (≤5μm) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing are not well-understood.
Methods: Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing.
Results: Among the 22 study participants, 13 (59\%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63–5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per patient. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA, and loads differed significantly between breathing, talking, and singing. The largest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was emitted by singing (53\%), followed by talking (41\%) and breathing (6\%). Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85\% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative.
Conclusions: Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to fine aerosols should be mitigated, especially in indoor environments where airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an important enquiry for future studies.},

	abstract = {Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through virus-containing aerosol particles has been established as an important pathway for Covid-19 infection. Suitable measures to prevent such infections are imperative, especially in situations when a high number of persons convene in closed rooms. Here we tested the efficiency and practicability of operating four air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters in a high school classroom while regular classes were taking place. We monitored the aerosol number concentration for particles {\textgreater}3 nm at two locations in the room, the aerosol size distribution in the range from 10 nm to 10 µm, PM10 and CO2 concentration. For comparison, we performed similar measurements in a neighboring classroom without purifiers. In times when classes were conducted with windows and door closed, the aerosol concentration was reduced by more than 90\% within less than 30 min when running the purifiers (air exchange rate 5.5 h−1). The reduction was homogeneous throughout the room and for all particle sizes. The measurements are supplemented by a calculation estimating the maximum concentration levels of virus-containing aerosol from a highly contagious person speaking in a closed room with and without air purifiers. Measurements and calculation demonstrate that air purifiers potentially represent a well-suited measure to reduce the risks of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 substantially. Staying for 2 h in a closed room with a highly infective person, we estimate that the inhaled dose is reduced by a factor of six when using air purifiers with a total air exchange rate of 5.7 h−1.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of deaths and great economic loss globally. There has been substantial evidence supporting the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Airborne route has been considered as a major transmission pathway, which can spread the disease over a longer distance and time. The viral loads in the respiratory tract of a virus carrier are typically below 109 RNA copies/mL and are related to the emission rate of pathogens. Most particles expelled during respiratory activities are smaller than 1–2 µm in diameter. Viral aerosols can remain infectious for hours under typical indoor conditions. Sunlight contributes greatly to the viability inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks in different scenarios are reviewed based on existing data. Most outbreaks were related to long-term care facilities, K-12 schools, restaurants, retail facilities, and offices. The Wells-Riley model for estimating the risk of airborne transmission is introduced, along with model parameters such as the quanta generation rate, virus-containing particle size distribution, and inactivation rate. The effectiveness of various IAQ control strategies for mitigating the airborne transmission risk is analyzed, including PPE, ventilation strategies, partitions, air cleaning, and disinfection technologies, and occupancy control strategies. Both benefits and costs should be considered in designing the control strategies.},

The group judged 27 papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals as providing sufficient information on both ventilation rates and health effects to inform the relationship. Consistency was found across multiple investigations and different epidemiologic designs for different populations. Multiple health endpoints show similar relationships with ventilation rate. There is biological plausibility for an association of health outcomes with ventilation rates, although the literature does not provide clear evidence on particular agent(s) for the effects. Higher ventilation rates in offices, up to about 25 l/s per person, are associated with reduced prevalence of sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms. The limited available data suggest that inflammation, respiratory infections, asthma symptoms and short-term sick leave increase with lower ventilation rates. Home ventilation rates above 0.5 air changes per hour (h−1) have been associated with a reduced risk of allergic manifestations among children in a Nordic climate. The need remains for more studies of the relationship between ventilation rates and health, especially in diverse climates, in locations with polluted outdoor air and in buildings other than offices. Practical Implications Ventilation with outdoor air plays an important role influencing human exposures to indoor pollutants. This review and assessment indicates that increasing ventilation rates above currently adopted standards and guidelines should result in reduced prevalence of negative health outcomes. Building operators and designers should avoid low ventilation rates unless alternative effective measures, such as source control or air cleaning, are employed to limit indoor pollutant levels.},

Increasing the valid field of view of the system and accuracy through multi-sensors is critical to achieving an efficient tracking system. This paper uses two mmWave radar sensors for accurate object detection and tracking: two noise reduction stages to reduce noise and distinguish cluster groups. The presented data fusion method effectively estimates the transformation of the data alignment and synchronizes the result that can allow us to visualize the objects’ information acquired by one radar on another one. An efficient density-based clustering algorithm to provide high clustering accuracy is presented. The Unscented Kalman Filter tracking algorithm with data association tracks multiple objects simultaneously in terms of accuracy and timing. Furthermore, an indoor object tracking system is developed based on our proposed method. Finally, the proposed method is validated by comparing it with our previous system and a commercial system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method’s advantage is of positive significance for handling the effect of occlusions at higher numbers of weak data and for detecting and tracking each object more accurately.},

The CO2 concentration is widely used as an indicator of the pollutant contaminant in indoor air and it often changes with time on account of the number of occupants. With the proposed methodology, the number of occupants can be estimated from the realtime measurement of the CO2 concentration of the outdoor air and the indoor air. As known, not only occupants but also buildings themselves contribute to potential indoor-air-quality problems. ASHRAE Standard 62-1989R guideline gives the design ventilation rate based on both occupancy and building space. According to ASHRAE Standard 62-1989R, the estimated number of the occupants and the area of ventilation-controlled space are used to determine the design ventilation rate required for acceptable indoor air quality. This design ventilation rate allows the Heating, Ventilating and Air-conditioning system to produce the acceptable indoor air quality at efficient energy usage. The experimental results show the viability of the proposed method- controlling ventilation based on estimated occupants.},

	abstract = {Given that airtightness is recognized as an essential issue for low-energy dwellings, today it is often included in energy performance (EP) calculations, frequently through single-zone models with uniform air leakage. Because more consideration is often given to EP than to indoor air quality issues, air leakage through internal partitions is often disregarded. Therefore, additional studies are needed to check these assumptions. In the present study air leakage through the building envelope and through internal partitions is investigated. This paper presents the methodology used in an experimental study, conducted to measure multizone air leakages, using the guarded zone pressurization technique. We developed a detailed innovative database with 456 exterior and internal partition wall air leakage measurements, taken in 23 detached houses. For each wall, the database includes general information on the building, special requirements, the building's main characteristics, measurement protocol, type of wall, measurement input data and measurement results (CL, n, q50 and the reliability index developed). Then an analysis of this database is provided. The analysis reveals most important relationships. For instance, internal partition wall air leakage is not related to the envelope's airtightness level; instead, the type of building structure has greater influence. Through this study, we underline the impact on building airflows of more detailed modelling of internal and external air leakage in multizone approaches, with consequences on indoor air quality (IAQ) bedrooms where people spend most of their time. As a conclusion, we propose air leakage values and dispersion input data for multizone IAQ models.},

In the case of particle size, the particle size was divided by 100 nm or less and 100 to 1,000 nm, and the number of particles concentration, mass concentration, median diameter of particles, geometric average particle diameter, etc were measured. The occurrence conditions were the extruder temperature, the extruding speed of the nozzle, and the air flow rate, and experiments were conducted according to the change of conditions including the manufacturer's standard conditions. In addition, the utility of inhalation risk assessment was reviewed through a stability maintenance experiment for 6 h. As a result of the experiment, the size of the nanoparticles increased as the discharger temperature increased, as the discharge speed of the nozzle increased, and as the air flow rate decreased. Also, a constant pattern was shown according to the conditions. Even when particles were generated for a long time (6 h), the concentration was kept constant without significant deviation. The distribution of the particles was approximately 80 \% for particles of 60 nm to 260 nm, 1.7 \% for 1 µm or larger, 0.908 mg/m3 for the mass concentration, 111 nm for MMAD and 2.10 for GSD. Most of the ABS particles were circular with a size of less than 10 nm, and these circular particles were aggregated to form a cluster of grape with a size of several tens to several hundred nm.},

	abstract = {The ability to inexpensively monitor indoor air speed and direction on a continuous basis would transform the control of environmental quality and energy use in buildings. Air motion transports energy, ventilation air, and pollutants around building interiors and their occupants, and measured feedback about it could be used in numerous ways to improve building operation. However indoor air movement is rarely monitored because of the expense and fragility of sensors. This paper describes a unique anemometer developed by the authors, that measures 3-dimensional air velocity for indoor environmental applications, leveraging new microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology for ultrasonic range-finding. The anemometer uses a tetrahedral arrangement of four transceivers, the smallest number able to capture a 3-dimensional flow, that provides greater measurement redundancy than in existing anemometry. We describe the theory, hardware, and software of the anemometer, including algorithms that detect and eliminate shielding errors caused by the wakes from anemometer support struts. The anemometer has a resolution and starting threshold of 0.01 m/s, an absolute air speed error of 0.05 m/s at a given orientation with minimal filtering, 3.1° angle- and 0.11 m/s velocity errors over 360° azimuthal rotation, and 3.5° angle- and 0.07 m/s velocity errors over 135° vertical declination. It includes radio connection to internet and is able to operate standalone for multiple years on a standard battery. The anemometer also measures temperature and has a compass and tilt sensor so that flow direction is globally referenced regardless of anemometer orientation. The retail cost of parts is \$100 USD, and all parts snap together for ease of assembly.},

Continuous wave Doppler radar is a simple technology to face this problem due to its capability to detect human body movements (e.g., walk, run) and small chest wall vibrations associated to the cardiorespiratory activity. This work deals with a radar prototype operating at 2.4 GHz as a real-time occupancy sensor. The emphasis is on data processing approaches devoted to extract useful information from raw radar signal. Three different strategies, designed to detect human presence in indoor environments, are considered and the main goal is the assessment and comparison of their performance against experimental data collected in controlled conditions. The first strategy is based on the analysis of the standard deviation of the radar signal in time-domain; whereas the second one exploits the histogram of the time-varying signal amplitude. Finally, a third strategy based on an energy measure of the received signal Doppler spectrum is considered. The proposed detection algorithms are optimized through a set of calibration measurements and their performances and robustness are assessed by laboratory trials.},

In this work, the CO2 distribution in a naturally-ventilated classroom has been thoroughly characterized, gaining information not only on the effectiveness of diverse ventilation strategies but also on the expected differences between CO2 values when varying the sampling location within the room. The results confirm that an adequate renewal of the air in the room requires the use of cross-ventilation, with openings in different walls. Furthermore, it was found that ventilation is optimized, for a given total opening area, when the openings are distributed as much as possible among different windows. For most of the studied conditions, a global windows opening area of 1.24 m2 with an open door was typically enough to yield CO2 concentrations below 700 ppm. The CO2 readings displayed a noticeable and consistent dependency on the sampling height, with below-average values at 0.75 m, the highest concentrations at 1.5 m, and levels close to the average when sampling at a height of 2.2 m. For a given height, the influence of the sampling location within the room was weaker, and more dependent on the specific ventilation strategy applied. However, the tests consistently showed CO2 records significantly lower for sensors installed on the walls. Besides a detailed spatial and temporal characterization of the ventilation process under different ventilation strategies, these results are thought to provide useful and novel information for a judicious placement of CO2 monitoring systems.},

	abstract = {Blower door testing is commonly used to characterize exterior façade air leakage in buildings. This characterization is needed to improve the accuracy of energy models and certify building performance. Performing these tests in large buildings requires air flow rates that are sometimes impractical to achieve using available equipment, which necessitates testing in individual zones within those buildings. However, when performing these tests in individual zones, the conventional whole-suite tests are unable to isolate the required envelope flow characteristics and pressure neutralization tests are, in most cases, too logistically difficult to perform, which necessitates an investigation into alternative methods. In this study, two methods developed for use in row housing were adapted to a high-rise multi-unit residential building (MURB) context in which the test suite is surrounded by adjacent suites: The Love and Passmore method, and the Lstiburek method. The efficacy of these adapted techniques was assessed in a single suite located in a high-rise MURB that followed typical North American construction habits. To carry out these assessments, a combination of field data and calibrated CONTAM simulations are used. For the case study building, the Love and Passmore method exhibits exterior boundary characterization errors of 108\%, and is inappropriate for this characterization in high-rise MURBs. Alternatively, the Lstiburek method exhibits an exterior boundary characterization error of 0.2\%, but additional analysis showed the Lstiburek method exhibits greater sensitivity to measurement noise than the pressure neutralization method. As a result of this increased noise sensitivity, and because of the similar labour and equipment requirements, it is therefore also not recommended as a replacement for the pressure neutralization method. It is important to note that buildings constructed using different details and techniques may exhibit different results, which is a limitation of this study. Details related to these tests, including a discussion of potential shortcomings and strengths, are presented in this paper.},

The role of ventilation in removing exhaled airborne bio-aerosols and preventing cross infections has been multidisciplinary extensively studied after the SARS outbreak in 2003. The characteristics of droplet-borne, short-range airborne and long-range airborne transmission of infectious diseases were identified. Increasing ventilation rate can effectively reduce the risk of long-range airborne transmission, while it may be of little useful in preventing the droplet-borne transmission. To maintain the airflow direction from clean cubicles to dirty cubicles is an effective way to prevent the cross infection between cubicles, which is widely used in hospital isolation rooms. Field measurements showed that wrong air flow direction was due to poor construction quality or maintenance. The impacts of different airflow patterns on removing large droplets and fine droplet nuclei were discussed. Some new concepts in general ventilation systems and local personalized equipment were also introduced. This review updates current knowledge of the airborne transmission of pathogens and the improvement of ventilation efficiency concerning the infection prevention.},

	abstract = {A full-scale school ventilation performance test-bed is newly constructed to evaluate the effects of internal airflow on IAQ and cross-infection among students. The indoor airflow is controlled by return diffusers installed on the ceiling or the floor of a classroom. The removal performance of PM2.5 is measured according to the location of return diffusers in the school classroom, and the indoor airflow is analyzed using numerical simulation. The airflow angle is introduced to evaluate the possibility of cross-infection of infectious diseases between students at the height of their respiratory line. It is confirmed that the floor return is successfully reduced compared to the upper return at the height of the students' breathing line in the horizontal airflow, which has a high possibility of infection between students. The floor return reduces the dust removal time by 35\% from the ‘Unhealthy’ level to the ‘Good’ level for PM2.5 compared to the upper return, which is due to the optimal control of airflow inside the classrooms. Through a study on the optimization of the direction of indoor airflow in school classrooms, this paper can provide a basic design guide for the direction of airflow that can improve classroom air quality, which can improve students' right to learn, and reduce cross-infection between students due to infectious diseases.},

Thus, mechanical systems could potentially operate less if the real-time (RT) infiltration rate were known and used to adjust the mechanical ventilation rate. CONTAM models of two test houses on the campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology were verified with measurements and used to simulate hourly infiltration rates in three cities. The infiltration rates were passed to a theoretical controller that changed the hourly mechanical ventilation rate to meet the ventilation requirement. Simulated energy use and relative annual occupant exposure for this RT control strategy was compared with ventilating at a constant rate. Implementation of the RT control strategy resulted in annual average energy savings of \$66USD across both houses and three cities without increasing the annual occupant exposure compared with ventilating continuously at a constant rate.

	abstract = {Reliable methods to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at venues where people gather are essential for epidemiological surveillance to guide public policy. Communal screening of air in a highly crowded space has the potential to provide early warning on the presence and potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by studies early in the epidemic. As hospitals and public facilities apply varying degrees of restrictions and regulations, it is important to provide multiple methodological options to enable environmental SARS-CoV-2 surveillance under different conditions. This study assessed the feasibility of using high-flowrate air samplers combined with RNA extraction kit designed for environmental sample to perform airborne SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in hospital setting, tested by RT-qPCR. The success rate of the air samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2 was then compared with surface swab samples collected in the same proximity. Additionally, positive RT-qPCR samples underwent viral culture to assess the viability of the sampled SARS-CoV-2. The study was performed in inpatient ward environments of a quaternary care university teaching hospital in Singapore housing active COVID-19 patients within the period of February to May 2020. Two types of wards were tested, naturally ventilated open-cohort ward and mechanically ventilated isolation ward. Distances between the site of air sampling and the patient cluster in the investigated wards were also recorded. No successful detection of airborne SARS-CoV-2 was recorded when 50 L/min air samplers were used. Upon increasing the sampling flowrate to 150 L/min, our results showed a high success rate in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from the air samples (72\%) compared to the surface swab samples (9.6\%). The positive detection rate of the air samples along with the corresponding viral load could be associated with the distance between sampling site and patient. The furthest distance from patient with PCR-positive air samples was 5.5 m. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 detection was comparable between the two types of wards with 60\%–87.5\% success rate. High prevalence of the virus was found in toilet areas, both on surfaces and in air. Finally, no successful culture attempt was recorded from the environmental air or surface samples.},

	abstract = {The current revival of the American economy is being predicated on social distancing, specifically the Six-Foot Rule, a guideline that offers little protection from pathogen-bearing aerosol droplets sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space. The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the “cumulative exposure time,” the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline. Implications for contact tracing and quarantining are considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated. Particular consideration is given to respiratory jets, which may substantially elevate risk when face masks are not worn.},

Indoor CO2 measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO2-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments. The relative infection risk in a given environment scales with excess CO2 level, and thus, keeping CO2 as low as feasible in a space allows optimization of the protection provided by ventilation. We show that the CO2 level corresponding to a given absolute infection risk varies by {\textgreater}2 orders of magnitude for different environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are still associated with infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical recommendations for low-cost CO2-based indoor infection risk monitoring.},

	abstract = {Ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) are linked to numerous adverse health effects. However, fewer studies have evaluated the effects of coarse PM (larger than 2.5 μm in diameter), and ambient measurements of coarse PM are particularly sparse. Although low-cost PM sensors have been used to complement regulatory measurements of PM2.5, many of these sensors, such as the Plantower PMS5003, are ineffective in measuring coarse PM. The Alphasense OPCs have shown promise in detecting coarse PM and have been used in the field to measure PM10 concentrations. These field evaluations have identified inter-sensor variability. Although field evaluation is critical for understanding sensor performance under environmentally relevant conditions, it provides limited information about sensor response characteristics, which are essential for determining the factors that may affect sensor measurements and contribute to inter-sensor variability. This study aims to understand these factors by conducting a size-selectivity study using monodisperse particles, and evaluating the effect of instrument-specific properties, like flow rate and laser strength, on the sensor-reported sizes and number counts. This study also evaluates a common low-cost sensor, the Plantower PMS5003, and a newer version, the PMS6003, for size selectivity. Monodisperse dioctyl sebacate particles of various diameters (2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 μm) were generated using a flow-focusing monodisperse aerosol generator, and the performance of nine different OPCs was evaluated. For all sizes tested, the nine OPC-N3s detected the particles, showed a peak near the target diameter, and exhibited some inter-sensor variability. The four PMS5003s and four PMS6003s detected all particle sizes but assigned all particles to the smallest size bin i.e., 0.35 μm–1 μm. With an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) as a reference, the OPCs showed a positive bias for mean particle diameter and a coefficient of variance (CV) of less than 10\%. For number concentration, the OPCs showed a negative bias, compared to the APS, and inter-sensor variability increased with the particle diameter. The laser wavelength of the OPC-N3s varied between 600 and 650 nm and appeared to have some effect on inter-sensor variability of the mean size. The flow rate reported by the OPC appeared to affect the inter-sensor variability in the number concentration.},

We collocated nine LCSs and a reference PM2.5 instrument for 9 months, covering all local seasons, in Bengaluru, India. Using the collocation data, we evaluated the performance of the LCSs and trained around 170 ML models to reduce the observed bias in the LCS-measured PM2.5. The ML models included (i) Decision Tree, (ii) Random Forest (RF), (iii) eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and (iv) Support Vector Regression (SVR). A hold-out validation was performed to assess the model performance. Model performance metrics included (i) coefficient of determination (R2), (ii) root mean square error (RMSE), (iii) normalised RMSE, and (iv) mean absolute error. We found that the bias in the LCS PM2.5 measurements varied across different LCS types (RMSE = 8–29 µg m–3) and that SVR models performed best in correcting the LCS PM2.5 measurements. Hyperparameter tuning improved the performance of the ML models (except for RF). The performance of ML models trained with significant predictors (fewer in number than the number of all predictors, chosen based on recursive feature elimination algorithm) was comparable to that of the ‘all predictors’ trained models (except for RF). The performance of most ML models was better than that of the linear models. Finally, as a research objective, we introduced the collocated black carbon mass concentration measurements into the ML models but found no significant improvement in the model performance.},

In Indonesia, the government would rather implement public activity restriction than lockdown. The detailed comprehension of the effect of lockdown or similar policies on air pollution is valuable for making future policies about the control of pandemics as well as its effect on air quality. To understand the effect of public activity restriction (PAR) and its correlation with air pollution, mobile monitoring (MM) of particulate matter (PM2.5) was performed in the urban area of Bandung, Indonesia, in July 2021. Based on MM using a bicycle, we found that a PAR had an impact on air pollution. Our result showed that there was a decrease between 20\% and 30\% in 3 of 6 sub-districts. The advantage of MM was highlighted by the prominent visualization of the concentration of PM2.5 MM data at the level of the road. Localization of polluted roads could be seen clearly through the MM method. The uncovering effect of PAR on air pollution using the MM method will provide important insights for government and policymakers to develop future policy that controls air pollution for better citizen health.},

However, consensus on a structured low-cost sensor calibration and performance evaluation framework is lacking. Our study aims to devise a standardized low-cost sensor calibration protocol and evaluate the performance of various calibration algorithms. Extensive collocation data were collected in stationary and mobile settings in two American cities, New York and Boston. We trained the calibration models using stationary data aggregated at various intervals to examine the performance of several commonly used calibration algorithms described in the literature. Linear models provide consistently satisfactory calibration results, indicating linear responses from the low-cost sensors in our stationary test environment. Its simplicity is recommended for citizen science and education usages. Models that can account for non-linear relationships, especially random forest, perform well and transfer between sensors better than generalized linear regression models for PM2.5 calibration, which should be adopted for regulatory and scientific purposes. Data collected in a mobile validation campaign in Boston were passed through the best-performing calibration models to assess their transferability. The results indicate that models trained with data from a different urban environment and season in the stationary setting did not transfer well to a mobile setting. It is recommended that low-cost sensors should be calibrated more often than suggested in Environmental Protection Agency's air sensor performance evaluation guidelines and used in an environment that is as similar as possible to the calibration environment.},

The launch frequency is increased in late winter before the onset of rapid stratospheric ozone loss in September. Ozone hole metrics show that the yearly total column ozone and 14–21 km partial column ozone minimum values and September loss rate trends have been improving (less severe) since 2001. The 36-year record also shows interannual variability, especially in recent years (2019–2021). Here we show additional details of these 3 years by comparing annual minimum profiles observed on the date when the lowest integrated total column ozone occurs. We also compare the July–December time series of the 14–21 km partial column ozone values to the 36-year median with percentile intervals. The 2019 anomalous vortex breakdown showed stratospheric temperatures began warming in early September followed by reduced ozone loss. The minimum total column ozone of 180 Dobson units (DU) was observed on 24 September. This was followed by two stable and cold polar vortex years during 2020 and 2021 with total column ozone minimums at 104 DU (1 October) and 102 DU (7 October), respectively. These years also showed broad near-zero-ozone (loss saturation) regions within the 14–21 km layer by the end of September which persisted into October.

 Validation of the ozonesonde observations is conducted through the ongoing comparison of total column ozone measurements with the South Pole ground-based Dobson spectrophotometer. The ozonesondes show a more positive bias of 2 ± 3 \% (higher) than the Dobson following a thorough evaluation and homogenization of the long-term ozonesonde record completed in 2018.},

Limited information is available on the effectiveness of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration of traffic-related particles. Here we investigated the effectiveness of portable HEPA air cleaners in reducing indoor concentrations of traffic-related and other aerosols, including black carbon (BC), PM2.5, ultraviolet absorbing particulate matter (UVPM) (a marker of tobacco smoke), and fungal spores. This intervention study consisted of a placebo-controlled cross-over design, in which a HEPA cleaner and a placebo “dummy” were placed in homes for 4-weeks each, with 48-hour air sampling conducted prior to and during the end of each treatment period. The concentrations measured for BC, PM2.5, UVPM, and fungal spores were significantly reduced following HEPA filtration, but not following the dummy period. The indoor fraction of BC/PM2.5 was significantly reduced due to the HEPA cleaner, indicating that black carbon was particularly impacted by HEPA filtration. This study demonstrates that HEPA air purification can result in a significant reduction of traffic-related and other aerosols in diverse residential settings. This article is protected by copyright.

This paper formulates mathematically a spatial data aided incremental support vector regression (SalncSVR) for spatio-temporal PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ prediction. We conduct spatio-temporal PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ prediction over 13 monitoring stations in Auckland New Zealand, and compare the proposed SalncSVR with a pure temporal IncSVR prediction.},

	abstract = {During winter nights, woodsmoke may be a predominant source of air pollution, even in cities with many sources. Since two major earthquakes resulted in major structural damage in 2010 and 2011, reliance on woodburning for home heating has increased substantially in Christchurch, New Zealand (NZ), along with intensive construction/demolition activities. Further, because NZ is a relatively isolated western country, it offers the unique opportunity to disentangle multiple source impacts in the absence of long-range transport pollution. Finally, although many spatial saturation studies have been published, and levoglucosan is an established tracer for woodburning emissions, few studies have monitored multiple sites simultaneously for this or other organic constituents, with the ability to distinguish spatial patterns for daytime vs. nighttime hours, in complex urban settings. We captured seven-day integrated samples of PM2.5, and elemental and organic tracers of woodsmoke and diesel emissions, during “daytime” (7 a.m. – 5:30 p.m.) and “nighttime” (7 p.m. – 5:30 a.m.) hours, at nine sites across commercial and residential areas, over three weeks in early winter (May 2014). At a subset of six sites, we also sampled during hypothesized “peak” woodburning hours (7 p.m. – 12 a.m.), to differentiate emissions during “active” residential woodburning, vs. overnight smouldering. Concentrations of PM2.5 were, on average, were twice as high during nighttime than daytime [µ = 18.4 (SD = 6.13) vs. 9.21 (SD = 6.13) µg/m3], with much greater differences in woodsmoke tracers (i.e., levoglucosan [µ = 1.83 (SD = 0.82) vs. 0.34 (SD = 0.17) µg/m3], potassium) and indicators of treated- or painted-wood burning (e.g., arsenic, lead). Only nitrogen dioxide, calcium, iron, and manganese (tracers of vehicular emissions) were higher during daytime. Levoglucosan and most PAHs were higher during “active” woodburning, vs. overnight smouldering. Our time-stratified spatial saturation detected strong spatial variability throughout the study area, which distinctly differed during daytime vs. night time hours, and quantified the substantial contribution of woodsmoke to overnight spatial variation in PM2.5 across Christchurch. Daytime vs. nighttime differences were greater than those observed across sites. Traffic, especially diesel, contributed substantially to daytime NO2 and spatial gradients in non-woodsmoke constituents.},

	abstract = {Low-cost, light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors are becoming more widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and indoor environments because of their low cost and ability to provide high spatial and temporal resolution PM information. Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study, a low-cost, particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time, cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel, the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade, light-scattering instruments, and in the ambient tests, the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating microbalance and one beta attenuation monitor) and gravimetric federal reference methods (FEMs/FRMs) as well as one research-grade instrument (GRIMM). The PMS sensor response correlates well with research-grade instruments in the wind-tunnel tests, and its response is linear over the concentration range tested (200–850 μg/m3). In the ambient tests, this PM sensor correlates better with gravimetric methods than previous studies with correlation coefficients of 0.88. However additional measurements under a variety of ambient conditions are needed. Although the PMS sensor correlated as well as the research-grade instrument to the FRM/FEMs in ambient conditions, its response varies with particle properties to a much greater degree than the research-grade instrument. In addition, the PMS sensors overestimate ambient PM concentrations and begin to exhibit a non-linear response when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 40 μg/m3. These results have important implications for communicating results from low-cost sensor networks, and they highlight the importance of using an appropriate correction factor for the target environmental conditions if the user wants to compare the results to FEM/FRMs.},

Incorporating all relevant factors into the model may be able to capture these changes, however, this is usually not practical. Data stream based methods, which instead explicitly detect concept drift, have been shown to retain performance under unknown changing conditions. These methods adapt to concept drift by training a model to classify each distinct data distribution. However, we hypothesize that existing methods do not robustly handle real-world tasks, leading to adaptation errors where context is misidentified. Adaptation errors may cause a system to use a model which does not fit the current data, reducing performance. We propose a novel repair algorithm to identify and correct errors in concept drift adaptation. Evaluation on synthetic data shows that our proposed AiRStream system has higher performance than baseline methods, while is also better at capturing the dynamics of the stream. Evaluation on an air quality inference task shows AiRStream provides increased real-world performance compared to eight baseline methods. A case study shows that AiRStream is able to build a robust model of environmental conditions over this task, allowing the adaptions made to concept drift to be analysed and related to changes in weather. We discovered a strong predictive link between the adaptions made by AiRStream and changes in meteorological conditions.},

The results indicate a systematic overestimation in the prior emissions for Christchurch of at least 40–60\%, which is consistent with some of the un10 derlying assumptions used in the composition of the bottom-up emissions map used as the prior, highlighting the uncertainties in bottom-up approaches for estimating PM2.5 emissions maps.},

In support of MAPM, a winter ﬁeld campaign was conducted in New Zealand in 2019 (June to September) to obtain the measurements required to test and validate the MAPM methodology. Two different types of instruments measuring PM were deployed: ES-642 remote dust monitors (17 instruments) 5 and Outdoor Dust Information Nodes (ODINs; 50 instruments). The measurement campaign was bracketed by two intercomparisons where all instruments were co-located, with a permanently installed Tapered Element Oscillating Membrane (TEOM) instrument, to determine any instrument biases. Changes in biases between the pre- and post-campaign intercomparisons were used to determine instrument drift over the campaign period. Once deployed, each ES-642 was co-located with an ODIN. In addition to the PM measurements, meteorological variables (temperature, pressure, wind speed and wind direction) were mea10 sured at three automatic weather station (AWS) sites established as part of the campaign, with additional data being sourced from 27 further AWSs operated by other agencies. Vertical proﬁle measurements were made in two intensive radiosonde subcampaigns and were supplemented with measurements made with a mini micropulse lidar and ceilometer. Here we present the data collected during the campaign and discuss the correction of the measurements made by various PM instruments. We ﬁnd that for while for the ODINs a correction based on environmental conditions is beneﬁcial, this results in over-ﬁtting and 15 increased uncertainties when applied to the measurements obtained using the more sophisticated ES-642s. We also compare PM2.5 and PM10 measured by ODINs which, in some cases, allows us to identify PM from natural and anthropogenic sources. The PM data collected during the campaign are publicly available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4023402 (Dale et al., 2020b), the data from other instruments are available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4021685 (Dale et al., 2020a).},

	abstract = {A low-cost, low power consumption indoor environment monitoring device, called SKOMOBO (SKOol MOnitoring Box), was developed. SKOMOBO includes the sensors to monitor temperature/relative humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter (PM) and motion (PIR). SKOMOBO was developed using the open source software on Arduino Pro Mini. 165 units of SKOMOBO were manufactured at Massey University (New Zealand) in September 2017. These units were then deployed across New Zealand to monitor the indoor air quality in primary school classrooms. This paper describes the practical deployment issues we faced and lessons learnt prior/during the field study aimed at understanding the connection between the air quality and student performance. We believe that the discussion in this paper is of importance and could potentially save a lot of money and effort for other similar sensor products.},

We have been developing a low-cost Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) platform called SKOMOBO which can monitor important IAQ parameters such as classroom temperature, relative humidly, particular matter and carbon dioxide level. Because our platform is designed in-house and utilizes low-cost sensors, there is a significant cost reduction and is affordable. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of SKOMOBO with the focus in several hardware and software engineering issues to explore the right set of strategies for developing a practical system. Through extensive experiments and evaluation, we have determined the various characteristic and issues associated with developing a low-cost sensor platform and their practical implications and mitigations.},

	abstract = {We develop a linear model based on a complex network approach that predicts the effect of emission changes on air pollution exposure in urban street networks including NO–NO2–O3-chemisty. The operational air quality model SIRANE is used to create a weighted adjacency matrix A describing the relation between emissions of a passive scalar inside streets and the resulting concentrations in the street network. A case study in South Kensington (London) is used, and the adjacency matrix A0 is determined for one wind speed and eight different wind directions. The physics of the underlying problem is used to infer A for different wind speeds. Good agreement between SIRANE predictions and the model is observed for all but the lowest wind speed, despite non-linearities in SIRANE's model formulation. An indicator for exposure in the street is developed, and it is shown that the out-degree of the exposure matrix E represents the effect of a change in emissions on the exposure reduction in all streets in the network. The approach is then extended to NO–NO2–O3-chemisty, which introduces a non-linearity. It is shown that a linearised model agrees well with the fully nonlinear SIRANE predictions. The model shows that roads with large height-to-width ratios are the first in which emissions should be reduced in order to maximise exposure reduction.},

This review provides an evaluation of the currently available literature and identifies research priorities in applying low-cost sensors (LCS) in PM2.5 environmental and health research in SEA. The research priority is an outcome of a series of participatory workshops under the umbrella of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project–Monsoon Asia and Oceania Networking Group (IGAC–MANGO). A literature review and research prioritization are conducted with a transdisciplinary perspective of providing useful scientific evidence in assisting authorities in formulating targeted strategies to reduce severe PM2.5 pollution and health risks in this region. The PM2.5 research gaps that could be filled by LCS application are identified in five categories: source evaluation, especially for the distinctive sources in the SEA countries; hot spot investigation; peak exposure assessment; exposure–health evaluation on acute health impacts; and short-term standards. The affordability of LCS, methodology transferability, international collaboration, and stakeholder engagement are keys to success in such transdisciplinary PM2.5 research. Unique contributions to the international science community and challenges with LCS application in PM2.5 research in SEA are also discussed.},

In these studies, people were already infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, in the present study, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in HEPA filters housed in portable air cleaners (PACs) located in places with apparently healthy people to prevent possible outbreaks. A method for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in HEPA filters was developed and validated. The study was conducted for 13 weeks in three indoor environments: school, nursery, and a household of a social health center, all in Ciudad Real, Spain. The environmental monitoring of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in HEPA filters and other surfaces of these indoor spaces for a selective screening in asymptomatic population groups. The objective was to limit outbreaks at an early stage. One HEPA filter tested positive in the social health center. After analysis by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in residents and healthcare workers, one worker tested positive. Therefore, this study provides direct evidence of virus-containing aerosols trapped in HEPA filters and the possibility of using these PACs for environmental monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 while they remove airborne aerosols and trap the virus.},

To mitigate it, many researchers have investigated the issue and attempted to accurately predict air pollutant concentrations using various methods. Currently, deep learning methods are the most prevailing ones. In this paper, we extend a comprehensive review on deep learning methods specifically for air pollutant concentration prediction. We start from the analysis on non-deep learning methods applied in air pollutant concentration prediction in terms of expertise, applications and deficiencies. Then, we investigate current deep learning methods for air pollutant concentration prediction from the perspectives of temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal correlations these methods could model. Further, we list some public datasets and auxiliary features used in air pollutant prediction, and compare representative experiments on these datasets. From the comparison, we draw some conclusions. Finally, we identify current limitations and future research directions of deep learning methods for air pollutant concentration prediction. The review may inspire researchers and to a certain extent promote the development of deep learning in air pollutant concentration prediction.},

	abstract = {This work assessed the potential impact on mortality and life expectancy that would occur due to reductions of indoor PM2.5 in dwellings in the UK using portable air purifiers. Reductions in indoor PM2.5 concentrations from air purifier use were modelled using findings from the literature for mean air purifier efficiency, mean indoor PM2.5 concentrations associated with air purifier use, and the relative risks associated with exposure. Life-table models were used to estimate changes to mortality from the following PM2.5-associated diseases: lung cancer, lower respiratory infection (LRI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and stroke. Different scenarios were modelled to represent a range of daily use patterns, the starting age of use and the duration of the intervention. The overall impact of the central scenario, in which air purifiers were used during all hours whilst at home (15.6 h) for the entirety of the modelled period (birth to 97 years), was to increase life expectancy in the birth cohort by, on average, 138 and 120 days for males and females, respectively, and to add more than 23 million years of life (YLG) to the UK population. When used at home, air purifiers reduced indoor PM2.5 concentrations and prolonged life expectancy, but questions regarding feasibility of the intervention, occupant behaviour and social inequities remain. The estimation of the impact of use by the whole population is, however, important for informing policy and designing interventions.},

However, characterization of these emission sources was not consolidated. This study focuses on the generation of aerosols and potential reduction in the context of playing wind instruments and singing. Aerosol concentration reduction means are evaluated using aerosol measurements in clean room and Computational Fluid Dynamics. Measurements at the bell of a clarinet and in front of singers are performed with or without a protection (bell cover for clarinet and surgical mask for singers). Numerical results on clarinet suggest that most of the supermicron (≥1μm) particles are trapped on the walls of the instruments, which act as a filter, depending on toneholes configurations (closed or opened) changing the frequency of sound produced. Experimental results are consistent since almost only submicron particles contribute to the measured number concentration during playing clarinet. First of all, the high inter and intra-individuals variability is highlighted, with high coefficients of variation. This study highlights the impact of fingerings on the generated particles and the efficiency of protections such as bell cover (from 3 to 100 times), depending on the played note and players. Results for singers show that surgical masks significantly reduce the aerosol concentration (from 8 to 170 times) in front of the mouth. The evolution of aerosol concentration is also correlated with sound intensity.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) is used to systematically analyse the impacts of trees on air quality in idealised street canyons. The LES tree model includes radiation, transpiration, drag and deposition effects. The superposition of background concentrations and local emissions is used to construct realistic urban scenarios for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Both neutral and convective atmospheric conditions are considered to assess the importance of buoyancy effects and the role of tree shading and transpiration. Tree impact on local air quality is shown to be driven by the balance between the rate at which they actively remove pollutants from the air (deposition) and the way in which they alter the transport of pollutants within and out of the street canyon (dispersion). For pollutant species or street types where the concentration field is dominated by background levels (such as PM2.5), deposition will generally dominate and thus local air quality will improve. For pollutants and street types where local emission sources dominate (e.g. NOx on a busy road), the dispersion effects of trees become more prominent and can lead to elevated concentrations where mixing or exchange is significantly inhibited. Mixing in the convective simulation is more vigorous than in the neutral simulation which results in substantial differences in in-canyon flow fields and exchange velocities, highlighting the importance of incorporating thermal effects when studying urban trees. Increased residency times, and thus deposition, under neutral conditions suggest that trees can have amplified effects under conditions conducive of poor air quality. For the cases considered, trees largely act to improve air quality with the exception of localised hotspots. The competing effects of trees — specifically deposition versus altered exchange with the atmosphere — are also incorporated in a simple integral model that predicts whether or not the air quality will improve. The model matches well with LES predictions for both PM2.5 and NOx and can serve as a simple tool for urban design purposes.},

The instrument uses an LED centered at 457 nm, high-finesse mirrors (reflectivity=0.999963 at 450 nm), and a grating spectrometer to determine optical extinction coefficients between 430\&ndash;476 nm, which are fit with custom spectral fitting software and published absorption cross sections. The instrument weighs 3.05 kg and has power consumption less than 35 W at 25 \&deg;C. A ground calibration unit provides helium and zero air flows to periodically determine the reflectivity of the cavity mirrors using known Rayleigh scattering cross sections. The precision (1\&sigma;) for laboratory measurements is 43 ppt NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ in 1 s and 7 ppt NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ in 30 s. Measurement of air with known NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ mixing ratios in the range of 0\&ndash;70 ppb agreed with the known values within 0.3 \% (slope=0.997\&plusmn;0.007; r$^{\textrm{2}}$=0.99983).

Hyperlocal long-term pollutant concentrations for nitrogen dioxide [NO2], nitric oxide [NO], and black carbon [BC] were measured at a resolution of 30 m using repeated street-level mobile measurements and linked to residential addresses. Health care utilization and costs were derived from KPNC databases and were used to calculate individual annual total health care, inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room (ER) and pharmacy costs. The associations between TRAP exposures and health care costs were evaluated using generalized estimating equation models adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, SES and comorbidities. Subgroup analyses and interaction models were used to assess differences among specific susceptible population subgroups.
Results
An IQR difference (10.1 ppb vs 4.2 ppb) in NO2 concentration was associated with a 3\% (95\% CI: -1\%, 6\%), 22\% (95\% CI:11\%, 35\%), and 5\% (95\% CI:1\%, 8\%) increase in annual total health care, ER and outpatient costs in the baseline model. Associations with black carbon showed similar patterns but were smaller in magnitude. Among those with cardiovascular diseases, an IQR increase in NO2 was associated with a 7\% (95\% CI: 1\%, 13\%) increase in total annual health care cost and 23\% (95\% CI: 17\%, 29\%) increase in ER costs.
Discussion
Higher long-term TRAP exposure was associated with higher direct annual health care cost in this elderly cohort. Those with existing cardiovascular disease had particularly strong associations between TRAP exposure and direct annual health care costs.},

We modeled 2015 and 2016 to account for meteorological variation with Korean emissions from the Clean Air Policy Supporting System (CAPSS), meteorology from WRF (Weather, Research, and Forecasting) model, and regional boundary concentrations from the GEOS-Chem global CTM. The CAMx particulate source apportionment technology (PSAT) provided PM2.5 source contributions from 5 source sectors and 6 geographic regions within Korea, international sources, and boundary concentrations. PM2.5 contributions from outside Korea are important with boundary concentrations plus the “other” emissions sector (includes marine shipping, agricultural ammonia, and international emissions from North Korea and Japan within the CAMx domain) contributing 67\% of annual average PM2.5 in Seoul in 2016 and 71\% in 2015. The boundary concentrations contributed between 30\% and 50\% of PM2.5 at different Korean cities with contributions generally lower in 2016 than in 2015. For Korean sources, PM2.5 contributions from Electric Generating Unit (EGU) emissions were smaller than contributions from mobile and industrial emissions sources although there is considerable day-to-day variation in contributions. On an annual basis in 2016, the “other” category contributed 25\% followed by mobile sources at 23\%, industrial sources at 6\%, and EGU sources at 3\%. For 2015, the contributions were similar. Focusing on March when PM2.5 concentrations were higher than other months, the contributions from other, mobile, industrial, and EGUs were 21\%, 18\%, 4\%, and 4\%, respectively in 2016. For 2015, contributions from these four categories were 18\%, 15\%, 3\%, and 3\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} When making measurements of air quality, having a reliable estimate of the measurement uncertainty is key to assessing the information content that an instrument is capable of providing, and thus its usefulness in a particular application. This is especially important given the widespread emergence of low cost sensors (LCS) to measure air quality. To do this, end users need to clearly identify the data requirements a priori and design quantifiable success criteria by which to judge the data. All measurements suffer from errors, with the degree to which these errors impact the accuracy of the final data often determined by our ability to identify and correct for them. The advent of LCS has provided a challenge in that many error sources show high spatial and temporal variability, making laboratory derived corrections difficult. Characterising LCS performance thus currently depends primarily on colocation studies with reference instruments, which are very expensive and do not offer a definitive solution but rather a glimpse of LCS performance in specific conditions over a limited period of time. Despite the limitations, colocation studies do provide useful information on measurement device error structure, but the results are non-trivial to interpret and often difficult to extrapolate to future device performance. A problem that obscures much of the information content of these colocation performance assessments is the exacerbated use of global performance metrics ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, RMSE, MAE, etc.). Colocation studies are complex and time-consuming, and it is easy to fall into the temptation to only use these metrics when trying to define the most appropriate sensor technology to subsequently use. But the use of these metrics can be limited, and even misleading, restricting our understanding of the error structure and therefore the measurements' information content. In this work, the nature of common air pollution measurement errors is investigated, and the implications they have on traditional metrics and other empirical, potentially more insightful approaches to assess measurement performance. With this insight we demonstrate the impact these errors can have on measurements, using a selection of LCS deployed alongside reference measurements as part of the QUANT project, and discuss the implications this has on device end use.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: While increasing the ventilation rate is an important measure to remove inhalable virus-laden respiratory particles and lower the risk of infection, direct validation in schools with population-based studies is far from definitive. Methods: We investigated the strength of association between ventilation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission reported among the students of Italy's Marche region in more than 10,000 classrooms, of which 316 were equipped with mechanical ventilation. We used ordinary and logistic regression models to explore the relative risk associated with the exposure of students in classrooms. Findings: For classrooms equipped with mechanical ventilation systems, the relative risk of infection decreased with the increase in ventilation: ventilation ranging from 10 to 14 L s-1 student-1 reduced the likelihood of infection for students by 80\% compared with a classroom with only natural ventilation. From the regression analysis, as confirmed by the predictive theoretical approach, we obtained a relative risk reduction in the range 12\%-15\% for each additional unit of ventilation rate per person. Interpretation: We need high ventilation rates ({\textgreater} 10 L s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ student\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) to protect students in classrooms from airborne transmission; this is higher than the rate needed to ensure indoor air quality. The excellent agreement between the results from the retrospective cohort study and the outcomes of the predictive theoretical approach makes it possible to assess the risk of airborne transmission for any indoor environment.},

	abstract = {Respiratory particles exhaled when an individual speaks and breathes can facilitate respiratory virus transmission. Portable air purification units can potentially reduce transmission risk by decreasing the overall infectious particle concentration in a room. This is particularly important for rooms with an inability to be ventilated with adequate amounts of filtered or outdoor air. While the efficacy of portable air filtration units on particle concentrations has been well-studied, the impact of portable air purification units on particle deposition and, hence, indirect aerosol transmission, has received lesser study but may be important for smaller spaces with greater surface area-to-volume ratios. We conducted a series of experiments in a simulated, small conference room (34.4 m3, mimicking a common office meeting room) assessing (1) particle removal rates and (2) changes in deposition rate owing to the presence of a low-cost box fan air purifier (BFAP). To mimic an infectious aerosol source, a breathing simulator manikin was utilized in these experiments, which ejected fluorescein tagged particles in the 1–3 μm size range throughout each experimental condition, with a prescribed, periodic, breathing waveform mimicking human exhalation. We measured deposition flux on upward- and downward-facing horizontal surfaces throughout the room and determined aerosol mass concentrations using impingers; combined, these data enabled estimates of surface-specific deposition velocities. Aerosol size distributions within the room were also quantified using an optical particle spectrometer. CFD simulations and theoretical calculations were simultaneously conducted for comparison to the experimental data. Results suggested the BFAP unit, which had an effective clean air delivery rate of 540 m3 h−1, increased the effective air exchange rate by 4.4x over baseline (20.1 vs. 4.5 h−1). Notably, BFAP unit operation introduced greater deposition to surfaces near the breathing simulator manikin vs. baseline, with deposition velocities within 2 m of the breathing simulator being 100 cm s−1 during BFAP operation, compared to 10−2 cm s−1 during baselines. Deposition velocities and air exchange rates generated from the CFD and theoretical calculations largely agreed with those derived from experiments. Taken together, data suggest that in smaller rooms, such as conference rooms, deposition is not negligible as a mechanism of aerosol clearance, even for particles near 1–3 μm in diameter.},

	abstract = {Poor indoor air quality has adverse health impacts. Children are considered a risk group, and they spend a significant time indoors at home and in schools. Air quality monitoring has traditionally been limited due to the cost and size of the monitoring stations. Recent advancements in low-cost sensors technology allow for economical, scalable and real-time monitoring, which is especially helpful in monitoring air quality in indoor environments, as they are prone to sudden peaks in pollutant concentrations. However, data reliability is still a considerable challenge to overcome in low-cost sensors technology. Thus, following a monitoring campaign in a nursery and primary school in Porto urban area, the present study analyzed the performance of three commercially available low-cost IoT devices for indoor air quality monitoring in real-world against a research-grade device used as a reference and developed regression models to improve their reliability. This paper also presents the developed on-field calibration models via machine learning technique using multiple linear regression, support vector regression, and gradient boosting regression algorithms and focuses on particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) data collected by the devices. The performance evaluation results showed poor detection of particulates in classrooms by the low-cost devices compared to the reference. The on-field calibration algorithms showed a considerable improvement in all three devices' accuracy (reaching up to R2 {\textgreater} 0.9) for the light scattering technology based particulate matter sensors. The results also show the different performance of low-cost devices in the lunchroom compared to the classrooms of the same school building, indicating the need for calibration in different microenvironments.},

The second step analyzes the episodic average and total pollution loading with respect to the within episode and prior episode meteorological conditions via the linear and random forest regression. A meteorological adjustment is conducted to remove the yearly meteorological variation in the estimated episodic air quality measures. Empirical analyses using the episode based assessment on four site clusters in three North China cities revealed that it offered sharper analysis and different perspectives on the underlying air quality than those based on the conventional full sample method due to the proper control in the episode selection.},

	abstract = {The increased frequency of wildfires in the Western United States has raised public awareness of the impact of wildfire smoke on air quality and human health. Exposure to wildfire smoke has been linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiorespiratory morbidity. Evidence-driven interventions can alleviate the adverse health impact of wildfire smoke. During wildfires, public health guidance is based on regional air quality data with limited spatiotemporal resolution. Recently, low-cost air quality sensors have been used in air quality studies, given their ability to capture high-resolution spatiotemporal data. We demonstrate the use of a network of low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors to gather indoor and outdoor PM2.5 data from seven locations in the urban Seattle area, along with a personal exposure monitor worn by a resident living in one of these locations during the 2020 Washington wildfire event. The data were used to determine PM concentration indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios, PM reduction, and personal exposure levels. The result shows that locations equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and HVAC filtration systems had significantly lower I/O ratios (median I/O = 0.43) than those without air filtration (median I/O = 0.82). The median PM2.5 reduction for the locations with HEPA is 58\% compared to 20\% for the locations without HEPA. The outdoor PM sensor showed a high correlation to the nearby regional air quality monitoring stations (pre-calibration R2 = 0.92). The personal monitor showed higher variance in PM measurements as the user moved through different microenvironments and could not be fully characterized by the network of indoor or outdoor monitors. The findings imply that evidence-based interventions can be developed to reduce pollution exposure when combining data from indoor and outdoor sensors. Personal exposure monitoring captured temporal spikes in PM exposure.},

In this study, we conducted in situ mobile measurements for the chemical composition of fine particles, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), and common gas pollutants in winter in the megacity of Beijing. The spatial patterns of these pollutants under different pollution conditions were investigated. During the non-haze days all pollutants showed significant spatial variability. Large spatial variations of secondary species including OVOCs and secondary aerosol species highlight the chemical heterogeneity. In particular, the inorganic chemical composition of fine particles varied greatly on the 65 km urban highway, suggesting a wide range of particle neutralization in the megacity of Beijing. Localized sources such as vehicle, cooking, and industrial emissions led to hot spots and nonuniform distributions of primary pollutants in the city. The spatial heterogeneity of air pollutants under less polluted conditions calls for a future need of using fine-resolution models to evaluate human exposure and to develop pollution control strategies. During the haze day the spatial variabilities of secondary gaseous and particulate pollutants were largely reduced, explained by both the elevated urban background of the polluted air mass and the enhanced secondary formation by elevated precursor concentrations and heterogeneous or aqueous pathways. Although localized primary emissions were accumulated under stagnant haze conditions, the chemical composition of fine particles became relatively homogeneous because of the predominant secondary contributions. A uniform spatial pattern of particle neutralization was observed. The concentrations of hydrocarbons and less oxygenated OVOCs showed good positive spatiotemporal correlations during the haze day, while the concentrations of more oxygenated OVOCs showed good positive correlations among themselves but moderate negative correlations with the concentrations of hydrocarbons, less oxygenated OVOCs, and aerosol species. Our results indicate a spatial chemical homogeneity on the megacity scale to promote efficient secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production under haze conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The spread of respiratory diseases via aerosol particles in indoor settings is of significant concern. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to spread widely in confined enclosures like hotels, hospitals, cruise ships, prisons, and churches. Particles exhaled from a person indoors can remain suspended long enough for increasing the opportunity for particles to spread spatially. Careful consideration of the ventilation system is essential to minimise the spread of particles containing infectious pathogens. Previous studies have shown that indoor airflow induced by opened windows would minimise the spread of particles. However, how outdoor airflow through an open window influences the indoor airflow has not been considered. The aim of this study is to provide a clear understanding of the indoor particle spread across multiple rooms, in a situation similar to what is found in quarantine hotels and cruise ships, using a combination of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning) ventilation and an opening window. Using a previously validated mathematical model, we used 3D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations to investigate to what extent different indoor airflow scenarios contribute to the transport of a single injection of particles (1.3μm) in a basic 3D multi-room indoor environment. Although this study is limited to short times, we demonstrate that in certain conditions approximately 80\% of the particles move from one room to the corridor and over 60\% move to the nearby room within 5 to 15 s. Our results provide additional information to help identifying relevant recommendations to limit particles from spreading in enclosures.},

We present a method to determine the relative risk of airborne transmission that can be readily deployed with either modelled or monitored CO2 data and occupancy levels within an indoor space. For spaces regularly, or consistently, occupied by the same group of people, e.g. an open-plan office or a school classroom, we establish protocols to assess the absolute risk of airborne infection of this regular attendance at work or school. We present a methodology to easily calculate the expected number of secondary infections arising from a regular attendee becoming infectious and remaining pre/asymptomatic within these spaces. We demonstrate our model by calculating risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored data recorded within a small naturally ventilated office. In addition, by inferring ventilation rates from monitored CO2, we show that estimates of airborne infection can be accurately reconstructed, thereby offering scope for more informed retrospective modelling should outbreaks occur in spaces where CO2 is monitored. Well-ventilated spaces appear unlikely to contribute significantly to airborne infection. However, even moderate changes to the conditions within the office, or new variants of the disease, typically result in more troubling predictions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Black carbon (BC) is an important atmospheric component with strong light absorption. Many attempts have been made to measure BC mass size distribution (BCMSD) for its significant impact on climate and public health. Larger-coverage BCMSD, ranging from upper submicron to larger than 1 \&mu;m, contributes to substantial proportion of BC absorption. However, current time resolution of larger-coverage BCMSD measurement was limited to 1 day, which was insufficient to characterize variation of larger-coverage BCMSD. In this study, a new method to determine BCMSD was proposed from size-resolved absorption coefficient measured by an aerodynamic aerosol classifier in tandem with an aethalometer. The proposed method could measure larger-coverage BCMSD with time resolution as high as 1 hour and was validated by comparing the measurement results with that measured by a differential mobility analyzer in tandem with a single particle soot photometer (DMA \&ndash; SP2) for particle size larger than 300 nm during a field measurement in Yangtze River Delta. Bulk BC mass concentration ({\textless}em{\textgreater}m{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{BC,bulk}}$) by DMA \&ndash; SP2 was underestimated by 33 \% compared to that by this method because of the limited size range of measurement for DMA \&ndash; SP2. Uncertainty analysis of this method was performed with respect to mass absorption cross-section (MAC), transfer function inversion, number fraction of BC-containing particle and instrumental noise. The results indicated that MAC was the main uncertainty source, leading to {\textless}em{\textgreater}m{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{BC,bulk}}$ varied from \&ndash; 20 \% to 28 \%. With the advanatage of wide size coverage up to 1.5 \&mu;m, high time resolution, easy operation and low cost, this method is expected to have wide applications in field measurement for better estimating radiative properties and climate effects of BC.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

After careful calibration of the sensors, based on co-location with reference instruments at a rural traffic site during 6 months and by using robust linear regression and random forest regression, the coefficient of determination of both types of sensors was high ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&gt;{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.9), and the root mean square error (RMSE) of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO{\textless}/span{\textgreater} and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sensors was about 6.8 and 3.5 ppb, respectively, for 10 min mean concentrations. The RMSE of the {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sensors, however, more than doubled when the sensors were deployed without recalibration for a 1-year period at other site types (including urban background locations), where the range and the variability of air pollutant concentrations differed from the calibration site. This indicates a significant effect of relocation of the sensors on the quality of their data. During deployment, we found that the {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sensors are capable of distinguishing general pollution levels, but they proved unsuitable for accurate measurements, mainly due to significant biases. In order to investigate the long-term stability of the original calibration, the sensors were reinstalled at the calibration site after deployment. Surprisingly, the coefficient of determination and the RMSE of the {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO{\textless}/span{\textgreater} sensor remained almost unchanged after more than 1 year of operation. In contrast, the performance of the {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sensors clearly deteriorated as indicated by a higher RMSE (about 7.5 ppb, 10 min mean concentrations) and a lower coefficient of determination ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}={\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.59).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Traditional air monitoring, performed by regulatory agencies, involves expensive regulatory-grade equipment and requires ongoing maintenance and quality control checks. The low-price tag, minimal operating cost, ease of use, and open data access are the primary driving factors behind the popularity of LCS. This study discusses the role and associated challenges of PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ sensors in monitoring air quality. We present the results of evaluations of the PurpleAir (PA.) PA-II LCS against regulatory-grade PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ federal equivalent methods (FEM) and the development of sensor calibration algorithms. The LCS calibration was performed for 2 to 4 weeks during December 2019\&ndash;January 2020 in Raleigh, NC, and Delhi, India, to evaluate the data quality under different aerosols loadings and environmental conditions. This exercise aims to develop a robust calibration model that uses PA measured parameters (i.e., PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$, temperature, relative humidity) as input and provides bias-corrected PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ output at an hourly scale. Thus, the calibration model relies on simultaneous measurements of PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ by FEM as target output during the calibration model development process. We applied various statistical and machine learning methods to achieve a regional calibration model. The results from our study indicate that, with proper calibration, we can achieve bias-corrected PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ data using PA sensors within 12 \% percentage mean absolute bias at hourly and within 6 \% for a daily average. Our study also suggests that pre-deployment calibrations developed at local or regional scales should be performed for the PA sensors to correct data from the field for scientific data analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We measured aerosol particle number size distribution at Baring Head, in coastal New Zealand, over a total period of 10 months to study aerosol properties and new particle formation, with a special focus on aerosol formation in open-ocean air masses. Particle concentrations were higher in land-influenced air compared to clean marine air in all size classes, from sub-10 nm to cloud condensation nuclei sizes. When classifying the particle number size distributions with traditional methods designed for continental sites, new particle formation was observed at the station throughout the year with an average event frequency of 23 \%. While most of these traditional event days had some land influence, we also observed particle growth starting from nucleation mode in 16 \% of the data in clean marine air, and at least part of this growth was connected to nucleation in the marine boundary layer. Sub-10 nm particles accounted for 29 \% of the total aerosol number concentration of particles larger than 1 nm in marine air during the spring. This shows that nucleation in marine air is frequent enough to influence the total particle concentration. Particle formation in land-influenced air was more intense and had on average higher growth rates than what was found for marine air. Particle formation and primary emissions increased particle number concentrations as a function of time spent over land during the first 1–2 d. After this, nucleation seems to start getting suppressed by the pre-existing particle population, but accumulation mode particle concentration keeps increasing, likely due to primary particle emissions. Further work showed that traditional NPF events were favoured by sunny conditions with low relative humidity and wind speeds. In marine air, formation of sub-10 nm particles was favoured by low temperatures, relative humidity, and wind speeds and could happen even during the night. Our future work will study the mechanisms responsible for particle formation at Baring Head with a focus on different chemical precursor species. This study sheds light on both new particle formation in open-ocean air masses coming from the Southern Ocean and local aerosol properties in New Zealand.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Therefore, it is important to have tools to better understand the transport and deposition phenomenon of emitted particles in order to take into account their consequences on safety devices. For this purpose and due to the lack of quantitative soot deposition data under realistic fire conditions, an innovative method for soot quantification in experimental facilities devoted to fire research has been developed. This method is based on the quantification of gases emitted during regeneration of a resistive sensor surface and has a higher detection limit than the electrical conductance quantification method previously proposed and validated by (Kort et al., 2021). A proof of feasibility has been shown for two types of soot and a prediction curve has been proposed for deposited masses which vary between 16 and 350 μg (1304 mg.m−2 and 28,525 mg.m−2). The applicability of this measurement method to realistic industrial fire situation is finally verified taking into account the mean deposition mass per surface area observed in this context.},

	abstract = {This study examines the concentrations and characteristics of carbonaceous aerosols (including saccharides) and inorganic species measured by PM2.5 filter sampling and a multi-wavelength Aethalometer during two campaigns in a mountainous, medium-sized, Greek city (Ioannina). The first campaign was conducted in summer and used as a baseline of low concentrations, while the second took place in winter under intensive residential wood burning (RWB) emissions. Very high winter-mean OC concentrations (26.0 μg m−3) were observed, associated with an OC/EC ratio of 9.9, and mean BCwb and PM2.5 levels of 4.5 μg m−3 and 57.5 μg m−3, respectively. Simultaneously, record-high levoglucosan (Lev) concentrations (mean: 6.0 μg m−3; max: 15.9 μg m−3) were measured, revealing a severely biomass burning (BB)-laden environment. The water-soluble OC component (WSOC) accounted for 56 ± 9\% of OC in winter, exhibiting high correlations (R2 = 0.93–0.97) with BB tracers (nss-K+, BCwb, Lev), nitrate and light absorption, potentially indicating the formation of water-soluble brown carbon (BrC) from fast oxidation processes. The examination of diagnostic ratios involving BB tracers indicated the prevalence of hardwood burning, while the mean Lev/OC ratio (22\%) was remarkably higher than literature values. Applying a mono-tracer method based on levoglucosan, we estimated very high BB contributions to OC (∼92\%), EC (∼64\%) and WSOC (∼87\%) during winter. On the contrary, low levels were registered during summer for all carbonaceous components, with winter/summer ratios of 4–5 for PM2.5 and BC, 10 for OC, 30 for BCwb and ∼1100 for levoglucosan. The absence of local BB sources in summer, combined with the photochemical processing and aging of regional organic aerosols, resulted in higher WSOC/OC fractions (64 ± 13\%). The results indicate highly soluble fine carbonaceous aerosol fraction year-round, which when considered alongside the extreme concentration levels in winter can have important implications for short- and long-term health effects.},

	abstract = {There is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is spread predominantly by airborne transmission, with high viral loads released into the air as respiratory droplets and aerosols from the infected subject. The spread and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in diverse indoor environments reinforces the urgent need to supplement distancing and PPE based approaches with effective engineering measures for microbial decontamination – thereby addressing the significant risk posed by aerosols. We hypothesized that a portable, single-pass UVC air treatment device (air flow 1254 L/min) could effectively inactivate bioaerosols containing bacterial and viral indicator organisms, and coronavirus without reliance on filtration technology, at reasonable scale. Robust experiments demonstrated UVC dose dependent inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus (UV rate constant (k) = 0.098 m2/J) and bacteriophage MS2, with up to 6-log MS2 reduction achieved in a single pass through the system (k = 0.119 m2/J). The inclusion of a PTFE diffuse reflector increased the effective UVC dose by up to 34\% in comparison to a standard Al foil reflector (with identical lamp output), resulting in significant additional pathogen inactivation (1-log S. aureus and MS2, p {\textless} 0.001). Complete inactivation of bovine coronavirus bioaerosols was demonstrated through tissue culture infectivity (2.4-log reduction) and RT-qPCR analysis – confirming single pass UVC treatment to effectively deactivate coronavirus to the limit of detection of the culture-based method. Scenario-based modelling was used to investigate the reduction in risk of airborne person to person transmission based upon a single infected subject within the small room. Use of the system providing 5 air changes per hour was shown to significantly reduce airborne viral load and maintain low numbers of RNA copies when the infected subject remained in the room, reducing the risk of airborne pathogen transmission to other room users. We conclude that the application of single-pass UVC systems (without reliance on HEPA filtration) could play a critical role in reducing the risk of airborne pathogen transfer, including SARS-CoV2, in locations where adequate fresh air ventilation cannot be implemented.},

Due to the detrimental effects particulate matter (PM) has on human health, PM sensors like photometers and optical particle counters (OPC) have been widely investigated. The negative effects of high relative humidity and fog events in the mass concentration readings of these types of sensors are well documented. In the literature, different solutions to these problems \&ndash; like correction models based on the K\&ouml;hler theory or machine learning algorithms \&ndash; have been applied. In this work, an air pre-conditioning method based on a low-cost, thermal dryer for a low-cost OPC is presented. The study was conducted in the laboratory under two different scenarios. In one case, we tested the efficiency of the low-cost dryer in the presence of fog. In the second case, we studied to which extent the low-cost dryer hinders the hygroscopic growth of inorganic aerosols. The results show that the sensor with the low-cost dryer at its inlet measured an average of 64 \% less PM2.5 concentration during the experiments with fog compared to a sensor without the low-cost dryer. In the experiments with hygroscopic aerosols, the sensor with the low-cost dryer measured 59 \% less PM2.5 concentration compared to a sensor without it. In light of these results, we believe that a low-cost, thermal dryer is a cost-effective add-on that can improve the accuracy of low-cost sensors under high relative humidity or during fog events. With the proposed air pre-conditioning method, the typical overestimation of the mass concentration readings is avoided, i.e., the sensor data are improved without the need for complex data post-processing. We believe that these low-cost dryers are very promising for the application of sensors in citizen science, in sensor networks for supplemental monitoring, and for epidemiological studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Air pollution has been a major concern in China, especially in densely populated megacities. Particulate pollutants, generally known as aerosols, have sizes that range widely and complex physical and chemical compositions with high spatiotemporal variabilities. We have conducted a series of experiments using the same comprehensive observation system, measuring various aerosol properties in the three megacities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Although there are differences in the total particle number concentration and particle number size distribution among the three sites due to differences in emission sources and sampling seasons, a high proportion of ultrafine particles was observed in all cities, i.e., 86.33\%, 88.34\%, and 81.1\%, respectively. The high particle number concentration at the Beijing and Guangzhou sites was caused by an increase in nucleation-mode particles at nighttime. The concentration of nucleation-mode particles at nighttime was significantly higher than during the daytime. We call this phenomenon a nocturnal nucleation event, and combined with analyses of factors involved, attribute this event to traffic emissions. To investigate the pollution sources at each location, we identified and quantified the pollution contributions from different sources by applying the k-means clustering analysis to observational datasets of environmental quantities. Clustering results showed that traffic emissions were the main contributor in Beijing and Guangzhou, with direct and significant impacts ranging from 37\% to 45\%, respectively.},

To reduce the evaporation-induced PM2.5 loss, the chilled Teflon filter sampler (CTF) was developed in which the sampling air was chilled to low temperatures (T) of 4–7 °C after dehumidification. The CTF with the aerosol flow dehumidified to low relative humidity (RH) of 25.50 ± 4.88\% by using a Nafion dehumidifier and chilled at 4 °C showed an accurate measurement for the total ion concentration with the mean normalized bias (MNB) of +4.17 ± 8.96\% as compared to the actual value measured by the porous denuder sampler (PDS). In comparison, the normal single Teflon filter sampler (STF) sampled PM2.5 ion concentration at ambient T and RH showed a negative MNB of −14.26 ± 13.66\%. It indicates that the 4 °C CTF can suppress the evaporation loss of SVIM and measure actual ion concentrations accurately. However, 4 °C CTF over-measured PM2.5 concentrations with the MNB of +15.01 ± 7.99\% as compared to −10.40 ± 5.92\% of the STF, due to normal and capillary condensations of water vapor although the condensed water on particles prevented SVIM evaporation loss. After correcting for the remaining water concentration determined by using surrogate TiO2 nanoparticles, the accuracy of PM2.5 concentrations was improved significantly with the MNB of only about +2.93 ± 8.56\%. To avoid excessive remaining water, the CTF was chilled to 7 °C and found to be able to reduce the evaporation loss of SVIM while measuring PM2.5 concentrations accurately with the MNB of +4.92 ± 6.52\% without remaining water correction in most sampling days.},

In this study, a novel portable CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ measuring system suitable for operations on-board small-sized UAVs has been developed and validated. It is based on a low-cost commercial nondispersive near-infrared (NDIR) CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ sensor (Senseair AB, Sweden), with a total weight of 1058 g, including batteries. The system performs in situ measurements autonomously, allowing for its integration into various platforms. Accuracy and linearity tests in the lab showed that the precision remains within \&plusmn;1 ppm (1\&sigma;) at 1 Hz. Corrections due to temperature and pressure changes were applied following environmental chamber experiments. The accuracy of the system in the field was validated against a reference instrument (Picarro, USA) onboard a piloted aircraft and it was found to be \&plusmn;2 ppm (1\&sigma;) at 1 Hz and \&plusmn;1 ppm (1\&sigma;) at 1 min. Due to its fast response, the system has the capacity to measure CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ mole fraction changes at 1 Hz, thus allowing the monitoring of CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emission plumes and the characteristic of their spatial and temporal distribution. Details of the measurement system and field implementations are described to support future UAV platform applications for atmospheric trace gas measurements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our system is based on the condensation nucleation method; however, it counts particles based on their electrostatic properties (i.e., dielectric constant) to overcome the limitations of complex optical systems that have traditionally been employed. The new system consists of two components: a microfluidic particle growth channel to grow UFPs into micron-sized water droplets and a capacitive particle counter to count the grown droplets. To effectively reduce the size and cost of the system, each system was fabricated into a single module using a semiconductor manufacturing process prior to integration. Super-hydrophilic micropillar wicks were monolithically integrated with Printed Circuit Board substrate channels to use water as the condensing working fluid. A glass substrate interdigitated electrode chip with a 3 μm gap was fabricated and placed on the impaction plate of an inertial impactor to be used as a sensor. Numerical calculations were performed to verify the dimensions of the channel required for efficient supersaturated vapor generation. Quantitative experiments using NaCl, (NH4)2SO4, and Ag2O UFPs showed that our system could grow particles larger than 50 nm into micron-sized droplets and count up to 10,300 N cm−3 particles with linear electrostatic properties.},

Data from a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer in an eastern Chinese megacity (Hangzhou) before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown (5 January to February 29, 2020) was used to understand the effect lockdown had on atmospheric particles. The collected single particle mass spectra were clustered into eight categories.

During the lockdown period, the EC and Fe-rich particles decreased by 42.8\% and 93.2\% compared to before lockdown due to reduced vehicle exhaust and industrial activity. By contrast, the K-SN and K–Na particles containing biomass burning tracers increased by 155.2\% and 45.2\% during the same time, respectively. During the lockdown, the proportions of particles ranked in order of: K-SN (39.7\%) {\textless} EC (38.1\%) {\textless} K–Na (11.0\%) {\textless} ECOC (7.7\%) {\textless} OC (1.2\%) {\textless} K–Pb (0.9\%) {\textless} Fe-rich (0.8\%) {\textless} K–Al (0.6\%). Back trajectory analysis indicated that both inland (Anhui and Shandong provinces) and marine transported air masses may have contributed to the increase in K–SN and K–Na particles during the lockdown, and that increased number of fugitive combustion points (i.e., household fuel, biomass combustion) was a contributing factor.

	abstract = {Accurate mass measurements of aerosol nanoparticles are inherently challenging. Beyond pure mass determination, such as can be realized using centrifugal particle mass analysis, aerosol mass spectrometry also enables material-specific analysis. In this work, the hyphenation of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer working in single particle mode (sp-ICP-MS) with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) is presented. The coupling of the instruments is described, with special attention to the position of the gas exchange device, which allows flexible interconnection of DMA and ICP-MS while maintaining the full classification range of the DMA. The mass calibration of the ICP-MS signal and the limits in terms of particle concentration were studied on spherical gold nanoparticles. As an application example, the structure of gold nanoparticle agglomerates was characterized as a function of a preceding temperature treatment. The fractal dimension and the effective density of the agglomerates is directly determined after sintering at various temperatures. In addition, a new approach to derive the primary particle diameter from the measurement of agglomerate mass is outlined. Finally, the possibility of analyzing the particle charge is shown in perspective.},

The article provides perspectives on current and future challenges as well as research needs for selected key topics. While this paper is not an exhaustive review of all research areas in the field of air quality, we have selected key topics that we feel are important from air quality research and policy perspectives. After providing a short historical overview, this review focuses on improvements in characterizing sources and emissions of air pollution, new air quality observations and instrumentation, advances in air quality prediction and forecasting, understanding interactions of air quality with meteorology and climate, exposure and health assessment, and air quality management and policy. In conducting the review, specific objectives were (i) to address current developments that push the boundaries of air quality research forward, (ii) to highlight the emerging prominent gaps of knowledge in air quality research, and (iii) to make recommendations to guide the direction for future research within the wider community. This review also identifies areas of particular importance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference on Air Quality 2020 (held online due to the COVID 19 restrictions during 18–26 May 2020), but the article incorporates a wider landscape of research literature within the field of air quality science. On air pollution emissions the review highlights, in particular, the need to reduce uncertainties in emissions from diffuse sources, particulate matter chemical components, shipping emissions, and the importance of considering both indoor and outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are regulated by guidelines. Connecting various physical scales in air quality modelling is still a continual issue, with cities being affected by air pollution gradients at local scales and by long-range transport. At the same time, one should allow for the impacts from climate change on a longer timescale. Earth system modelling offers considerable potential by providing a consistent framework for treating scales and processes, especially where there are significant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology. Assessment of exposure to air pollution should consider the impacts of both indoor and outdoor emissions, as well as application of more sophisticated, dynamic modelling approaches to predict concentrations of air pollutants in both environments. With particulate matter being one of the most important pollutants for health, research is indicating the urgent need to understand, in particular, the role of particle number and chemical components in terms of health impact, which in turn requires improved emission inventories and models for predicting high-resolution distributions of these metrics over cities. The review also examines how air pollution management needs to adapt to the above-mentioned new challenges and briefly considers the implications from the COVID-19 pandemic for air quality. Finally, we provide recommendations for air quality research and support for policy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Monitoring particulate matter (PM) in mine sites is challenging owing to the intermittent PM emission and dispersion over widespread areas at these locations. In these circumstances, multiple monitoring stations, including PM sensors, should be installed to monitor PM distributions throughout the site. However, this may result in high operation costs. Monitoring based on low-cost PM sensors is advantageous with respect to cost, though its poor data quality is problematic. Yet, big data processing techniques can be utilized to remedy this drawback. This study proposed a strategic solution to enhance the data reliability of low-cost PM monitoring through big data processing. The significance of an effective calibration was emphasized to overcome the poor quality of low-cost PM sensor data. In particular, this study focused on the usefulness of blind calibration for adjustment of background PM levels and the traditional linear regression-based calibration through direct comparison between low-cost and reference sensor data. The applicability of an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) algorithm was also considered for automatic decision making and implementation of the whole calibration, as well as for global optimization in nonlinear regression coefficients with a high complexity.},

In particular, a simulation-based risk analysis approach enables scenario evaluation and comparison to guide decision making and action prioritization under uncertainty. We develop a simulation model to characterize the risks and uncertainties associated with infections resulting from aerosol exposure in in-person classes. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to model a semester of courses in a real college with approximately 11,000 students embedded within a larger university. To have practical impact, risk cannot focus on only infections as the end point of interest, we estimate the risks of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths of students and faculty in the college. We incorporate uncertainties in disease transmission, the impact of policies such as masking and facility interventions, and variables outside of the college’s control such as population-level disease and immunity prevalence. We show in our example application that universal use of masks that block 40\% of aerosols and the installation of near-ceiling, fan-mounted UVC systems both have the potential to lead to substantial risk reductions and that these effects can be modeled at the individual room level. These results exemplify how such simulation-based risk analysis can inform decision making and prioritization under great uncertainty.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses, through an extensive literature review, the use of ventilation and High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) purifiers as practical mitigation strategies for reducing the spread of aerosolized COVID-191 virus. HEPA is a well-defined standard by the U.S. Department of Energy for filters. The focus of the literature review was on indoor air quality (IAQ) and COVID-19, with a particular emphasis on classroom settings. The start of the review, January 2020, was chosen to coincide with the first cases of COVID-19 in North America. Although children under the age of 12 are currently not yet vaccinated, there is mounting pressure for a return to normal by the start of the new school year, 2021. Also, many classrooms lack pre-installed mechanical ventilation systems (Olsiewski et al., 2021); therefore, mitigation in classrooms often falls solely in the hands of teachers and students. Research shows that ventilation and air purification are essential tools to counter aerosolized transmission (Curtius et al. (2020), the inhaled dose of particles containing virus RNA is six times lower when using air purifiers with an ACH (air changes per hour) of 5.7. However, ventilation and air purifiers are not replacements for masks, which remain vital for countering droplet ({\textgreater}5 μm) transmission. In addition, occupancy (i.e., number and proximity of people present in a given area) and group activity levels (e.g., talking, shouting, singing) play a critical role in viral transmission. Although natural ventilation by opening windows can be an essential strategy to help counter the spread of the virus, the level of ventilation offered by opening windows is largely uncontrollable as it is subject to weather conditions and building design. One must also consider the energy implications (i.e., loss of heat) that this strategy carries. Scientific evidence shows that varying levels of continuous and/or intermittent ventilation, either mechanical or natural, combined with the use of HEPA air purifiers, can provide a higher degree of protection than window access alone (Curtius et al., 2020). Systematic deployment of a hybrid mitigation strategy incorporating both ventilation and HEPA air purification in schools, offices, or other facilities offers a practical way to establish a safe re-opening of society in Canada.},

	abstract = {Aerosol particles are one of the main routes of transmission of COVID-19. Mobile air purifiers are used to reduce the risk of infection indoors. We focus on an air purifier which generates a defined volumetric air flow through a highly efficient filter material. We investigate the transport of aerosol particles from an infected dummy equipped with an aerosol generator to receiving thermal dummies. For analysis, we use up to 12 optical particle counters to monitor the particle concentration with high spatial resolution. Based on the measurement data, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is set up and validated. The experimental and numerical methods are used to investigate how the risk of infection suggested by the particle exposure in an exemplary lecture hall can be reduced by a clever choice of orientation of the air purifier. The particle concentration at head height deviates by 13 \% for variations of location and orientation. Finally, CFD simulation was used to monitor the particle fates. The steady simulation results fit quite well to the experimental findings and provide additional information about particle path and for assessing comfort level due to air flow.
Practical implications Different installation locations and operating conditions of the air purifier are evaluated and the use of thermal dummies mimics the conditions of practical use cases. The measurement results show the integral particle mass over time in the “faces of the dummies”, representing the potentially inhaled particle load of persons present in the room. At an air change per hour of 5, the cumulated PM1 mass at head level was reduced by 75 \%, independently of the location of the infected dummy, compared to the “natural decay” case showing that filtration is an effective means of reducing aerosol particle concentrations. It turns out that obstructing the outlet stream of the air purifier may be particularly advantageous.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To study the airflow, transmission, and clearance of aerosols in the clinical spaces of a hospital ward that had been used to care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to examine the impact of portable air cleaners on aerosol clearance.


Design:
Observational study.


Setting:
A single ward of a tertiary-care public hospital in Melbourne, Australia.


Intervention:
Glycerin-based aerosol was used as a surrogate for respiratory aerosols. The transmission of aerosols from a single patient room into corridors and a nurses’ station in the ward was measured. The rate of clearance of aerosols was measured over time from the patient room, nurses’ station and ward corridors with and without air cleaners [ie, portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters].


Results:
Aerosols rapidly travelled from the patient room into other parts of the ward. Air cleaners were effective in increasing the clearance of aerosols from the air in clinical spaces and reducing their spread to other areas. With 2 small domestic air cleaners in a single patient room of a hospital ward, 99\% of aerosols could be cleared within 5.5 minutes.


Conclusions:
Air cleaners may be useful in clinical spaces to help reduce the risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses that are transmitted via aerosols. They are easy to deploy and are likely to be cost-effective in a variety of healthcare settings.},

	abstract = {Respirable aerosols ({\textless} 5 µm in diameter) present a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during aerosol-generating procedures, and droplet ({\textgreater} 5 µm) precautions at other times. However, emerging evidence indicates respiratory activities may be a more important source of aerosols than clinical procedures such as tracheal intubation. We aimed to measure the size, total number and volume of all human aerosols exhaled during respiratory activities and therapies. We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 l.min-1 to count and size-fractionate close to all exhaled particles (0.5–25 µm). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during six respiratory activities (quiet breathing; talking; shouting; forced expiratory manoeuvres; exercise; and coughing) with three respiratory therapies (high-ﬂow nasal oxygen and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation). Activities were repeated while wearing facemasks. When compared with quiet breathing, exertional respiratory activities increased particle counts 34.6-fold during talking and 370.8-fold during coughing (p {\textless} 0.001). High-ﬂow nasal oxygen 60 at l.min-1 increased particle counts 2.3-fold (p = 0.031) during quiet breathing. Single and dual circuit non-invasive respiratory therapy at 25/10 cm.H2O with quiet breathing increased counts by 2.6-fold and 7.8-fold, respectively (both p {\textless} 0.001). During exertional activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared with activities alone. Respiratory activities (including exertional breathing and coughing) which mimic respiratory patterns during illness generate substantially more aerosols than non-invasive respiratory therapies, which conversely can reduce total emissions. We argue the risk of aerosol exposure is underappreciated and warrants widespread, targeted interventions.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of particulate air pollution in Suva, Fiji, have been largely unknown and consequently, current strategies to reduce health risk from air pollution in Suva are not targeted effectively. This lack of air quality data is common across the Pacific Island Countries. A monitoring study, during 2014 and 2015, has characterised the fine particulate air quality in Suva, representing the most detailed study to date of fine aerosol air pollutants for the Pacific Islands; with sampling at City, Residential (Kinoya) and Background (Suva Point) sites. Meteorology for Suva, as it relates to pollutant dispersion for this period of time, has also been analysed. The study design enables the contribution of maritime air and the anthropogenic emissions to be carefully distinguished from each other and separately characterised. Back trajectory calculations show that a packet of air sampled at the Suva City site has typically travelled 724 km in the 24-h prior to sampling, mainly over open ocean waters; inferring that pollutants would also be rapidly transported away from Suva. For fine particulates, Suva City reported a mid-week PM2.5 of 8.6 ± 0.4 μg/m3, averaged over 13-months of gravimetric sampling. Continuous monitoring (Osiris laser photometer) suggests that some areas of Suva may experience levels exceeding the WHO PM2.5 guideline of 10 μg/m3, however, compared to other countries, Fiji's PM2.5 is low. Peak aerosol particulate levels, at all sites, were experienced at night-time, when atmospheric conditions were least favourable to dispersion of air pollutants. Suva's average ambient concentrations of black carbon in PM2.5, 2.2 ± 0.1 μg/m3, are, however, similar to those measured in much larger cities. With any given parcel of air spending only seven minutes, on average, over the land area of Suva Peninsula, these black carbon concentrations are indicative that significant combustion emissions occur within Suva. Many other communities in the Pacific Islands, as well as in Africa, Asia and South America share similar climate and similar burning practices and as such are likely to experience similar aerosol black carbon loadings. These black carbon levels indicate the need for combustion emissions, particularly those from open burning and diesel usage, to be addressed in air policy.},

High school students in Norway used these sensor systems in a citizen science project to design, carry out, and evaluate their own research projects on air quality. An impact assessment framework was designed to assess the impact of these activities, considering five areas of impact: scientific, social, economic, political, and environmental. In addition, the framework also considers the transformative potential of the citizen science pilot, i.e., the degree to which the pilot can help to change, alter, or replace current systems, and the business-as-usual in one or more fields such as knowledge production or environmental protection. Data for this assessment were gathered in the form of questionnaires that the students had to complete before starting and after finalizing the pilot activities. The results showed positive impacts on learning, a pro-environmental world view, and an increase in pro-science attitudes and interest in scientific and environmental-related topics at the end of the pilot activities. Only weak impacts were measured for behavioral change. The activities showed transformative potential, which makes the student activities an example of good practice for citizen science activities on air quality with low-cost sensors.},

We estimated the measurement accuracy of two AQMesh devices, evaluated their agreement, and examined the related calibration characteristics. Three widely used calibration approaches were investigated, namely uni- and multi-variate linear regression analysis and the random forest algorithm. Two identical commercial AQMesh platforms (monitoring NO, NO2, O3, and SO2) were installed on a fixed municipal station for 4 consecutive weeks. Widely used statistical indexes were employed to evaluate device performance and calibration outcomes. The devices exhibited favorable performance in following the pattern of the station’s reference time series in a 10-min average resolution. Nevertheless, their performance was lower, with respect to the reference values, in terms of the average error and overall bias. The calibration improved the agreement between the device and reference measurements. The emission time series of each device was consistent with the other (pre- and post-calibration) in terms of measurement patterns and point-by-point deviations. The three alternative methodologies had similar calibration performance overall. The random forest algorithm appeared to have an advantage in several cases, mostly in terms of following the pattern in the O3 and SO2 time series, but also in terms of the average error and bias for all pollutants.},

	abstract = {Spray drift is one of the main sources of pesticide contamination. For this reason, an accurate understanding of this phenomenon is necessary in order to limit its effects. Nowadays, spray drift is usually studied by using in situ collectors which only allow time-integrated sampling of specific points of the pesticide clouds. Previous research has demonstrated that the light detection and ranging (lidar) technique can be an alternative for spray drift monitoring. This technique enables remote measurement of pesticide clouds with high temporal and distance resolution. Despite these advantages, the fact that no lidar instrument suitable for such an application is presently available has appreciably limited its practical use. This work presents the first eye-safe lidar system specifically designed for  the monitoring of pesticide clouds. Parameter design of this system is carried out  via signal-to-noise ratio simulations. The instrument is based on a 3-mJ pulse-energy erbium-doped glass laser, an 80-mm diameter telescope, an APD optoelectronic receiver and optomechanically adjustable components. In first test measurements, the lidar system has been able to measure a topographic target located over 2 km away. The instrument has also been used in spray drift studies, demonstrating its capability to monitor the temporal and distance evolution of several pesticide clouds emitted by air-assisted sprayers at distances between 50 and 100 m.},

This technique has been successfully used for several years to measure in situ atmospheric trace gases. A property of optical cavities is that in the presence of strong absorbers or scatterers the light path is reduced, in contrast to classical long-path DOAS measurements where the light path is fixed. Typical CE-DOAS or BB-CEAS evaluation schemes correct this effect using the measured total light intensity attenuation. This makes them sensitive to any variations in the light intensity not arising from the trace gas absorption. That means an important DOAS advantage, to be independent of total light intensity, is actually lost. In order to cope with this problem, the instrument setup would require a thorough stabilisation of the light source and a very rigid mechanical setup, which would make instrumentation more complex and error prone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We present a new approach to cavity-enhanced (CE) DOAS based on an iterative algorithm (ICAD) which actually models the light path reduction from the derived absorbers in the optical resonator. It allows a sensitive and robust data analysis that does not depend on the total light intensity, allowing a simpler and more compact instrument setup. The algorithm is discussed and simulated measurements demonstrate its sensitivity and robustness. Furthermore, a new ICAD {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} instrument is presented. It takes advantage of the advanced data evaluation to build a compact (50\&thinsp;cm cavity) and lightweight instrument ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&lt;10{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;kg) with low power consumption (25\&thinsp;W) for sensitive measurements of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} with a detection limit of 0.02\&thinsp;ppbv at an averaging time of 7\&thinsp;min. The instrument is characterised with a {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} calibration source and good long-term stability is demonstrated in a comparison with a commercial chemiluminescence detector. As a new application of ICAD we show measurements on an automobile platform to investigate the two-dimensional {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} distribution in an urban area.

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) has been used as a common technique to simultaneously measure abundances of a variety of atmospheric trace gases. Exploiting the unique differential absorption cross section of trace-gas molecules, mixing ratios can be derived by measuring the optical density along a deﬁned light path and by applying the Beer–Lambert law. Active long-path (LP-DOAS) instruments can detect trace gases along a light path of a few hundred metres up to 20 km, with sensitivities for mixing ratios down to ppbv and pptv levels, depending on the trace-gas species. To achieve high measurement accuracy and low detection limits, it is crucial to reduce instrumental artefacts that lead to systematic structures in the residual spectra of the analysis. Spectral residual structures can be introduced by most components of a LP-DOAS measurement system, namely by the light source, in the transmission of the measurement signal between the system components or at the level of spectrometer and detector. This article focuses on recent improvements by the ﬁrst application of a new type of light source and consequent changes to the optical setup to improve measurement accuracy.},

Low-cost PM sensors are especially beneficial in low and middle-income countries where few, if any, reference grade measurements exist and in areas where the concentration fields of air pollutants have significant spatial gradients. Unfortunately, low-cost PM sensors also come with a number of challenges that must be addressed if their data products are to be used for anything more than a qualitative characterization of air quality. The various PM sensors used in low-cost monitors are all subject to biases and calibration dependencies, corrections for which range from relatively straightforward (e.g. meteorology, age of sensor) to complex (e.g. aerosol source, composition, refractive index). The methods for correcting and calibrating these biases and dependencies that have been used in the literature likewise range from simple linear and quadratic models to complex machine learning algorithms. Here we review the needs and challenges when trying to get high-quality data from low-cost sensors. We also present a set of best practices to follow to obtain high-quality data from these low-cost sensors.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric new-particle formation (NPF) affects climate by contributing to a large fraction of the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) drive the early particle growth and therefore substantially influence the survival of newly formed particles to CCN. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) is known to suppress the NPF driven by HOMs, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we examine the response of particle growth to the changes of HOM formation caused by NOx. We show that NOx suppresses particle growth in general, but the suppression is rather nonuniform and size dependent, which can be quantitatively explained by the shifted HOM volatility after adding NOx. By illustrating how NOx affects the early growth of new particles, a critical step of CCN formation, our results help provide a refined assessment of the potential climatic effects caused by the diverse changes of NOx level in forest regions around the globe.
NOx is important for particle growth as it can participate in HOM formation and alter the HOM volatility distribution.

To assess their suitability, we deployed six Sensit Real-time, Affordable, Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) monitors measuring PM2.5, NO, NO2, CO2, O3 and CO in three parking garages on the UBC Vancouver campus from April–August 2019. UBC Parking Services provided real-time vehicle counts to help validate our method. After sensor calibration, integrated pollutant and CO2 signals were converted to fuel-based emission factors (EFs). Our calculated EFs fell within the range of previous studies. Evening EFs when vehicles were cold were 10–50\% higher than in the morning. We also observed a disproportional contribution of high emitters; the top 25\% of plumes contributed 45–65\% of total emissions. Our findings indicate that low-cost sensors are a promising technology for real-world vehicle emissions measurement.},

Estimates are made using “top-down” and “bottom-up” methods that demonstrate good agreement to within 1.1\% for total fuel consumed or CO2 emitted. A central component of this study is the comprehensive nature of the bottom-up emission estimates that combine highly detailed remote sensing emission data with over 4000 km of 1 Hz real driving data. Total annual UK NH3 emissions from gasoline passenger cars are estimated to be 7.8 ± 0.3 kt from the bottom-up estimate compared with 3.0 ± 1.7 kt reported by the UK national inventory. An important conclusion from the analysis is that both methodologies confirm that gasoline passenger car NH3 emissions are underestimated by a factor of about 2.6 compared with the 2018 UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. Furthermore, we find that inventory estimates of urban emissions of NH3 for passenger cars are underestimated by a factor of 17.},

In support of MAPM, a winter field campaign was conducted in New Zealand in 2019 (June to September) to obtain the measurements required to test and validate the MAPM methodology. Two different types of instruments measuring PM were deployed: ES-642 remote dust monitors (17 instruments) and Outdoor Dust Information Nodes (ODINs; 50 instruments). The measurement campaign was bracketed by two intercomparisons where all instruments were co-located, with a permanently installed Tapered Element Oscillating Membrane (TEOM) instrument, to determine any instrument biases. Changes in biases between the pre- and post-campaign intercomparisons were used to determine instrument drift over the campaign period. Once deployed, each ES-642 was co-located with an ODIN. In addition to the PM measurements, meteorological variables (temperature, pressure, wind speed and wind direction) were measured at three automatic weather station (AWS) sites established as part of the campaign, with additional data being sourced from 27 further AWSs operated by other agencies. Vertical profile measurements were made in two intensive radiosonde sub-campaigns and were supplemented with measurements made with a mini micropulse lidar and ceilometer. Here we present the data collected during the campaign and discuss the correction of the measurements made by various PM instruments. We find that for while for the ODINs a correction based on environmental conditions is beneficial, this results in over-fitting and increased uncertainties when applied to the measurements obtained using the more sophisticated ES-642s. We also compare PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ and PM$_{\textrm{10}}$ measured by ODINs which, in some cases, allows us to identify PM from natural and anthropogenic sources.

	abstract = {The growth of megacities from global urbanization has degraded urban air quality sufficient to impede economic growth and create a public health hazard. Emissions of particulate matter, photochemically reactive gases, and long-lived greenhouse gases, contribute to the urban environmental footprint with concomitant economic and social costs. Mitigation actions rely critically on knowing where these emissions occur. In response to this challenge, our team has developed a new method, MAPM (Mapping Air Pollution eMissions), to generate near real-time surface emissions maps of particulate matter pollution. Surface particulate matter (PM 2.5) emission maps will be derived from atmospheric measurements of
particulate matter using an inverse model in conjunction with a
state-of-the-art mesoscale atmospheric model.The MAPM methodology is validated and refined using particulate matter measurements made during a field campaign that took place in Christchurch, New Zealand from June to September 2019. Key questions that MAPM aims to answer include:How do uncertainties on the PM 2.5 measurements affect the quality of the emissions maps we extract from our inverse model. How do uncertainties in the meteorological data affect the quality of the emissions maps we extract from our inverse model. How does the spatial and temporal resolution of the air pollution concentration measurements affect the uncertainties in the retrieved pollution emissions maps? Here we will not only present the measurements made during the winter field campaign but also present the first derived PM 2.5 emissions maps for the city of Christchurch.},

	abstract = {Innovation and technological development have led to a proliferation of various low-cost air quality monitors, most of which use light scattering techniques to detect airborne particles. As these monitors are used in various environments, their testing should also be performed in diverse environments and with different particle types. This study evaluated three Foobot units and three AirVisual Nodes in two laboratory environments and in one residential apartment when measuring five types of aerosols (0.72 and 2.00 µm polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres, Arizona Road Dust (ARD), nanosilver-based surface cleaner, and particles created by a cooking event). The low-cost monitors were highly correlated with the DustTrak DRX (TSI) for most aerosol types (r {\textgreater} 0.78), except when measuring nanosilver spray, where the r value decreased to 0.55. For PSL spheres, Foobot overestimated DRX PM2.5 concentrations while AirVisual's readings were closer to those of DRX and aligned relatively well with the 1:1 line. Both Foobot and AirVisual underestimated PM2.5 concentrations for ARD, nanosilver spray, and particles from a cooking event. Overall, the Foobots reported higher PM2.5 concentrations than the AirVisuals, except when measuring particles created by the cooking event. The paired monitors' precision error varied between 0.15 and 0.47, depending on the aerosol type and monitor pairs. The coefficient of variation ranged from 15.2\% to 21.0\% for the Foobots and from 12.5\% to 28.7\% for the AirVisuals. Both monitors showed high accuracy and precision when measuring temperature and humidity as compared to the IAQ Meter (TSI Inc.). AirVisual showed high accuracy and precision when measuring CO2, as compared to the IAQ meter. Foobot, however, didn't report accurate CO2 concentrations. Additionally, we found the AirVisual is easier to operate, and it provided more options to read, save, and download data.},

	abstract = {Metalworking fluids used in industrial workshops may present a major threat to the health of workers who have been exposed to a high oil mist concentration over a long period of time. Therefore, monitoring the temporal and spatial distribution of particulate matter concentration has great practical significance for the control of oil mist. Traditional particle monitors are generally cumbersome, expensive, and difficult to maintain, which to some extent restricts their extensive use in workshops. Recent years have witnessed tremendous developments in the area of low-cost sensors, which are of great help in obtaining high-density pollution data. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an inexpensive laser sensor (A4-CG) during long-term oil mist monitoring in a machine shop for the first time. With the use of Lora technology, we developed an online oil mist monitoring network to access real-time concentration, temperature, and humidity information from distributed monitors. According to the results, the sensor data correlated well with measurements by the reference instrument (R2 = 0.96), which means that the distributed sensor network can accurately detect the concentration level of oil mist in the workshop. In fact, most of the sensors demonstrated stable operation for up to half a year according to cluster analysis, while several sensors exhibited serious data drift. Furthermore, the results indicate that the peak oil mist concentration in most areas during production exceeded the value of 0.5 mg m−3 recommended by NIOSH, and it was found that appropriately lowering the relative humidity can make sampling more accurate, while lowering the temperature can reduce the oil mist concentration in the workshop. Thus, measures to control oil mist such as generation and distribution of pollution sources should be on the agenda.},

	abstract = {Attention has been paid to low-cost, light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors, which provide PM measurements in order to supplement a small number of expensive air quality monitoring stations. However, low-cost PM sensors produce measurement data of questionable quality. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of low-cost PM sensors, specifically PurpleAir PA-II units. To evaluate the PurpleAir PA-II units, we use accurate air quality data measured from monitoring stations within close proximity to the PA-II units as reference. By means of linear regression, we compare PurpleAir PA-II units with air quality monitors. From the result, PurpleAir PA-II units have high correlations (R2 ≥ 0.84) with nephelometers, which are based on the principle of light-scattering, and thus the PurpleAir PA-II is a sufficient substitute for nephelometers. PurpleAir PA-II units have a good agreement (R2 = 0.72 and 0.89) with MetOne BAM 1020 monitors based on beta ray attenuation but show a non-linear behavior. Furthermore, there is an essential observation that the PurpleAir PA-II unit needs to have significantly high precision in order to have a high correlation with an expensive reference monitor and thus be used supplementally. The considered PurpleAir PA-II units overestimate PM2.5 concentrations compared with air quality reference monitors. Therefore, a calibration algorithm for PurpleAir PA-II units should be considered to give a correct air quality index at sites considered in this paper. However, our results show the PurpleAir PA-II to be a promising low-cost air quality sensor for supplementing a conventional air quality sensing network with expensive monitors.},

The affordability of such devices allows researchers, institutions, and private entities alike to create sensor networks in their local regions to monitor various pollutants. Many of these networks are on the city-scale, but only a few, if any, have focused on a more concentrated network. This research focuses on the utility of such a network on a university campus scale by analyzing measurements made from 15 sensors over a period of 9 months. Initial results indicate that while the network provides a wealth of data, variation amongst the sensor readings is low especially when considering daily averages in a cleaner environment like Austin, TX. Our work suggests that low-cost sensor networks in cleaner environments are better suited in networks that span larger geographical areas and data collected from them used to understand hourly or diurnal trends.},

However, because of their working conditions, they are not efficiently working at high temperatures, humid, and high concentrated environment (e.g. emission from vehicle exhaust).

Due to the effect of the temperature and water vapour condensation on the sensor accuracy, both exhaust emission parameters have been calculated. The theoretical results show that the sensor can correctly work under the different temperature of sampled emission.},

The accuracy of these low-cost sensors can be difficult to guarantee as they are often in harsh environments and are more susceptible to environmental impacts than high-end measurement devices. Periodic calibration of sensors has proven to be an effective approach for improving the accuracy of low-cost sensor data and maintaining its reliability when used in sensor networks for long-term monitoring.

	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) sensors are popular for distributed monitoring due to their portability, low-cost and networking capabilities. To provide reliable data, these sensors have to be calibrated periodically in the laboratory. This is often done in chambers with several of them co-located, alongside several research grade instruments. It is important to confirm that the aerosol is well distributed to ensure reliability and accuracy of the calibration tests. This paper describes a modeling and experimental study of these chambers used for calibration of PM sensors. The experimental setup is described and calibration results for the low-cost PM sensors (MAXIMA sensor, Applied Particle Technology, Inc.) using research-grade instruments (GRIMM 11-C, GRIMM Technologies, Inc.) are presented. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model including effects of turbulence and Brownian motion is used to predict particle trajectories and distribution in the chamber. The simulated particle number concentration agrees well with the measured values in the chamber. Having the CFD model, the suitability of three proposed chamber designs (fan off; fan on-parallel; fan on-diagonal) are explored for a variety of conditions. Operating conditions that result in uniform concentrations are established using the model. The recommended design for the PM sensor calibration in a rectangular ventilated chamber is: parallel fan layout, fan pressure of 12 Pa, and inlet air flow rate between 10 and 15 L/min. This study shows that the numerical modeling is available to understand the performance of a calibration chamber as well as optimizing the chamber design. A broader perspective is that the results validate the use of low-cost PM sensors for checking the distribution of aerosols in chambers.},

	abstract = {Air pollution monitoring has attracted much attention in recent years. However, accurate and high-resolution monitoring of atmospheric pollution remains challenging. There are two types of devices for air pollution monitoring, i.e., static stations and mobile stations. Static stations can provide accurate pollution measurements but their spatial distribution is sparse because of their high expense. In contrast, mobile stations offer an effective solution for dense placement by utilizing lowcost air monitoring sensors, whereas their measurements are less accurate. In this work, we propose a data-driven model based on deep neural networks, referred to as AirNet, for calibrating low-cost air monitoring sensors. Unlike traditional methods, which treat the calibration task as a point-to-point regression problem, we model it as a sequence-to-point mapping problem by introducing historical data sequences from both a mobile station (to be calibrated) and the referred static station. Speciﬁcally, AirNet ﬁrst extracts an observation trend feature of the mobile station and a reference trend feature of the static station via dual encoder neural networks. Then, a social-based guidance mechanism is designed to select periodic and adjacent features. Finally, the features are fused and fed into a decoder to obtain a calibrated measurement. We evaluate the proposed method on two real-world datasets and compare it with six baselines. The experimental results demonstrate that our method yields the best performance.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to report the results of a generalized additive model used to predict local particulate matter concentrations at a Washington, DC Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) federal regulatory monitoring station. While the DOEE uses state-of-the-art federal equivalent method (FEM) equipment to demonstrate compliance with the clean air act for regulatory purposes, these measurements reflect regional, not neighborhood air quality. A GW student-led living lab project—Fresh Air DC—has been testing uRAD INDUSTRIAL low-cost air quality sensors that can be used to collect air quality data at the neighborhood level using LoRaWAN based smart city technology. Because low-cost sensors often lack the accuracy and sensitivity of FEM equipment, research indicates that low-cost sensor (LCS) monitoring networks require post- processing and data modelling in order to apply findings to educational and policy goals. Although LCS data processing has been conducted using linear and nonlinear models, nonlinear models tend to have a greater ability to capture the nuanced relationships between air pollutants and meteorological influences. In this paper, we post-process uRAD PM 2.5 sensor data using DOEE FEM equipment as a reference instrument in the development of three models to adjust uRAD data to the DOEE FEM data—ordinary least squares linear regression, generalized linear models (GLMs), and generalized additive models (GAMs). Our model includes meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Our statistical models for post-processing are evaluated on the basis of deviance and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We expect that the GLM and GAM will be useful for capturing nonlinear relationships between the PM2.5 measurements and meteorological variables.},

	abstract = {Biomass burnings either due to Hazards Reduction Burnings (HRBs) in late autumn and early winter or bushfires during summer periods in various part of the world (e.g., CA, USA or New South Wales, Australia) emit large amount of gaseous pollutants and aerosols. The emissions, under favourable meteorological conditions, can cause elevated atmospheric particulate concentrations in metropolitan areas and beyond. One of the pollutants of concern is black carbon (BC), which is a component of aerosol particles. BC is harmful to health and acts as a radiative forcing agent in increasing the global warming due to its light absorption properties. Remote sensing data from satellites have becoming increasingly available for research, and these provide rich datasets available on global and local scale as well as in situ aethalometer measurements allow researchers to study the emission and dispersion pattern of BC from anthropogenic and natural sources. The Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) in New South Wales (NSW) has installed recently from 2014 to 2019 a total of nine aethalometers to measure BC in its state-wide air quality network to determine the source contribution of BC and PM2.5 (particulate Matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter) in ambient air from biomass burning and anthropogenic combustion sources. This study analysed the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterns of black carbon (BC) in New South Wales and in the Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) of Sydney, Australia, by using these data sources as well as the trajectory HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) modelling tool to determine the source of high BC concentration detected at these sites. The emission characteristics of BC in relation to PM2.5 is dependent on the emission source and is analysed using regression analysis of BC with PM2.5 time series at the receptor site for winter and summer periods. The results show that, during the winter, correlation between BC and PM2.5 is found at nearly all sites while little or no correlation is detected during the summer period. Traffic vehicle emission is the main BC emission source identified in the urban areas but was less so in the regional sites where biomass burnings/wood heating is the dominant source in winter. The BC diurnal patterns at all sites were strongly influenced by meteorology.},

	abstract = {During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.},

	abstract = {Air quality monitoring (AQM) is crucial for cities to develop management plans supporting population health. However, there is a dearth of measurements due to the high cost of standard reference instruments. Mobile AQM using low-cost sensors deployed on routine fleets of vehicles can enable the continuous detection of fine-scale pollutant variations in cities at a lower cost. New methods need to be developed to interpret these measurements. This paper presents three such methods. First, we propose a technique to identify aerosol hotspots. Second, we employ techniques published previously to assess the generalizable map of fine and coarse particle number concentrations, to understand qualitatively the contribution of local and regional sources across the region sampled. By using the raw number concentration of differently sized particles from the Optical Particle Counters (OPCs) instead of the noisier mass concentrations, we obtain more robust results. Third, in order to evaluate source signatures in cities, we propose another technique, in which we cluster the entire range of aerosol size-distribution measurements acquired. The properties of each cluster provide insight into the aerosol source characteristics in the sampling environment. We test these methods using a dataset we collected by mounting OPCs on two trash-trucks in Cambridge, Massachusetts.},

In spite of their huge explorative potential, practical guidelines and recommendations for their use are still limited. In this work, we outline a few best practices for the optimal use of PM low‐cost sensors based on the results of an intensive field campaign performed in Bologna (44°30′ N, 11°21′ E; Italy) under different weather conditions. Briefly, the performances of a series of sensors were evaluated against a calibrated mainstream OPC with a heated inlet, using a robust approach based on a suite of statistical indexes capable of evaluating both correlations and biases in respect to the reference sensor. Our results show that the sensor performance is sensibly affected by both time resolution and weather with biases maximized at high time resolution and high relative humidity. Optimization of PM data obtained is therefore achievable by lowering time resolution and applying suitable correction factors for hygroscopic growth based on the inherent particle size distribution.},

Around 3 billion people throughout the world use coal and biomass (crop residues, wood, dung, and charcoal) as the primary source of domestic energy. Moreover, humans spend 80–90\% of their routine time indoors, so indoor air quality (IAQ) leaves a direct impact on overall health and work efficiency. In this paper, the authors described the relationship between IAP exposure and associated risks. The main idea is to discuss the use of wireless technologies for the development of cyber-physical systems for real-time monitoring. Furthermore, it provides a critical review of microcontrollers used for system designing and challenges in the development of real-time monitoring systems.

Consumer IAQ monitors incorporating low-cost optical particle sensors and connections with smart home platforms could provide this service if they reliably detect PM2.5 in homes. In this study, particles from typical residential sources were generated in a 120 m3 laboratory and time-concentration profiles were measured with 7 consumer monitors (2-3 units each), 2 research monitors (Thermo pDR-1500, MetOne BT-645), a Grimm Mini Wide-Range Aerosol Spectrometer (GRM), and a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance with Filter Dynamic Measurement System (FDMS), a Federal Equivalent Method for PM2.5. Sources included recreational combustion (candles, cigarettes, incense), cooking activities, an unfiltered ultrasonic humidifier, and dust. FDMS measurements, filter samples, and known densities were used to adjust the GRM to obtain time-resolved mass concentrations. Data from the research monitors and 4 of the consumer monitors—AirBeam, AirVisual, Foobot, Purple Air—were time correlated and within a factor of 2 of the estimated mass concentrations for most sources. All 7 of the consumer and both research monitors substantially under-reported or missed events for which the emitted mass was comprised of particles smaller than 0.3 μm diameter.},

These studies rely upon chronic, averaged measures of air pollution, which fosters a static conception of exposure disparities. This paper examines PM2.5 exposure disparities in Salt Lake County (SLC), Utah public schools under three different PM2.5 scenarios—relatively clean air, a moderate winter persistent cold air pool (PCAP), and a major winter PCAP—with respect to race/ethnicity, economic deprivation, student age, and school type. We pair demographic data for SLC schools (n = 174) with modelled PM2.5 values, obtained from a distributed network of sensors placed through a community-university partnership. Results from generalized estimating equations controlling for school district clustering and other covariates reveal that patterns of social inequality vary under different PM2.5 pollution scenarios. Charter schools and schools serving economically deprived students experienced disproportionate exposure during relatively clean air and moderate PM2.5 PCAP conditions, but those inequalities attenuated under major PCAP conditions. Schools with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minority students were unequally exposed under all PM2.5 pollution scenarios, reflecting the robustness of racial/ethnic disparities in exposure. The findings speak to the need for policy changes to protect school-aged children from environmental harm in SLC and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {The use of low-cost sensor technology to monitor air pollution has made remarkable strides in the last decade. The development of low-cost devices to monitor air quality in indoor environments can be used to understand the behaviour of indoor air pollutants and potentially impact on the reduction of related health impacts. These user-friendly devices are portable, require low-maintenance, and can enable near real-time, continuous monitoring. They can also contribute to citizen science projects and community-driven science. However, low-cost sensors have often been associated with design compromises that hamper data reliability. Moreover, with the rapidly increasing number of studies, projects, and grey literature based on low-cost sensors, information got scattered. Intending to identify and review scientifically validated literature on this topic, this study critically summarizes the recent research pertinent to the development of indoor air quality monitoring devices using low-cost sensors. The method employed for this review was a thorough search of three scientific databases, namely: ScienceDirect, IEEE, and Scopus. A total of 891 titles published since 2012 were found and scanned for relevance. Finally, 41 research articles consisting of 35 unique device development projects were reviewed with a particular emphasis on device development: calibration and performance of sensors, the processor used, data storage and communication, and the availability of real-time remote access of sensor data. The most prominent finding of the study showed a lack of studies consisting of sensor performance as only 16 out of 35 projects performed calibration/validation of sensors. An even fewer number of studies conducted these tests with a reference instrument. Hence, a need for more studies with calibration, credible validation, and standardization of sensor performance and assessment is recommended for subsequent research.},

	abstract = {The construction industry is one of the significant sources which pollutes the environment. As 66 \% of the world’s population will move towards urban areas within 2050, the rate of construction work happening in the cities will be enormous. Thus, construction practitioners should be aware of Particulate matter (PM) exposure and associated health impacts on society living in urban areas and focus on executing targeted countermeasures. Low-cost sensors with higher sensitivity and higher saturation point can be used for PM measurements during the construction works. This study measures PM produced from a construction activity using low-cost sensors. A total of 4635 exposure samples were collected during the experiment from which the PM concentrations for PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 were recorded as 7731.32, 532.14, and 113.68 μg/m3 with a standard deviation (σ) of 1990.39, 64.97, and 12.06 μg/m3. The two-stage Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method supports the conclusion that even after implementing efficient control measures, the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 remain 30 and 8 fold higher than their respective 24-hs exposure standards. Thus, future research work should focus on creating targeted control measures, further research exploring the distribution of particles produced from different construction activities should be monitored.},

In the analysed period, significant changes in the daily distribution of road traffic both into and out of the city centre were observed. The average travel time depended on the direction of traffic, and the difference between directions being almost 50\%. The PM10 urban background concentration was also subject to daily changes, and in the fifth week of observation, it reached a value more than twice as high as in the first week of observation. The maximum level of road traffic participants' exposure was observed at a relatively low urban background PM10 concentration. It was observed that a significant slowdown in traffic in conditions of acceptable urban air quality led to a comparable level of exposure to that of standard traffic conditions and poor urban air quality. It was also found that the slowdown in traffic increased the exposure time of traffic participants travelling towards the city centre by an average of 24\% and, for those travelling in the opposite direction, by as much as 50\%. In an extreme case of traffic delay, exposure to PM10 concentration in the vicinity of the road was two and a half times as long.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5 are a key factor affecting personal pollution exposure levels in urban areas. However, fixed-site monitoring stations are so sparsely distributed that they hardly capture the dynamic and fine-scale variations in PM2.5 in urban areas with complex geographical features and urban forms. Recently, a distributed air sensor network (DASN) was deployed in Dezhou city, China, to monitor fine-scale air pollution information and obtain deep insight into variations in PM2.5. Based on the data collected by the DASN, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of PM2.5 using the time-series clustering method. The results demonstrated that there were four stages of PM2.5 daily variations, i.e., accumulation, continuous pollution, dispersion, and cleaning. Generally, the stage of dispersion occurred more rapidly than the stage of accumulation, and PM2.5 accumulated easily in warm and humid weather with low wind speeds. However, the stage of dispersion was affected mainly by high wind speeds and precipitation. Additionally, the results suggested that four variation stages did not strictly correspond to seasonal divisions. The spatial distributions of PM2.5 revealed that the main pollution source was located in a southeastern industrial park, which exhibited a significant impact throughout the four stages. Considering both the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5, we successfully identified pollution hotspots and confirmed the effect of industrial parks. This study demonstrates that the DASN has high prospective applicability for assessing the fine-scale spatial distribution of PM2.5, and the time-series clustering method can also assist environmental researchers in further exploring the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban air pollution.},

A total of 264 sensors including 27 sensors with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and 237 sensors with laser lighting sources were tested. Those tested sensors were classified into 4 groups based on the deviation from the reference data obtained by a reference instrument. The response linearities of all the tested samples for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 were in excellent agreement with the reference instrument, except a few samples. For the measurements of PM1 and PM2.5, the lighting source, that is, LED or laser, did not show any significant difference in overall sensor performance. However, LED-based sensors did not perform well for PM10 measurements. The 32, 24, and 16\% of all the tested sensors for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 measurement, respectively, are in the category of Class 1 (reference instrument reading ± 20\%) requirement. The performance of the low-cost dust sensors for PM10 measurement was relatively less satisfactory.},

	abstract = {The explosive growth in the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and the exponential increase in data consumption only reflect how the growth of big data perfectly overlaps with that of IoT. The management of big data in a continuously expanding network gives rise to non-trivial concerns regarding data collection efficiency, data processing, analytics, and security. To address these concerns, researchers have examined the challenges associated with the successful deployment of IoT. Despite the large number of studies on big data, analytics, and IoT, the convergence of these areas creates several opportunities for flourishing big data and analytics for IoT systems. In this paper, we explore the recent advances in big data analytics for IoT systems as well as the key requirements for managing big data and for enabling analytics in an IoT environment. We taxonomized the literature based on important parameters. We identify the opportunities resulting from the convergence of big data, analytics, and IoT as well as discuss the role of big data analytics in IoT applications. Finally, several open challenges are presented as future research directions.},

The 'sick building syndrome' (SBS) describes a set of nonspecific symptoms experienced by occupants due to time spent in a building with poor IAQ. Thus this study was undertaken to assess the IAQ in green buildings and compare it with that of conventional buildings. The prevalence of SBS in both types of buildings is also studied. In five pairs of green and conventional buildings measurements of comfort parameters (temperature \& relative humidity) and indoor air pollutants using monitors was done. 148 employees which included 84 from green buildings and 64 from conventional buildings were surveyed for SBS using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The analysis was done using SPSS16 and included Mann Whitney for IAQ pollutant concentrations and Chi-square for the SBS prevalence. Similar indoor air quality was found in both types of buildings. The mean of temperature, CO2 and formaldehyde was statistically lower in green buildings. The SBS prevalence was found to be 38.1\% in green buildings and 53.1\% in conventional buildings. Thus to conclude the poorly maintained green building does not have any added advantage for occurrence of SBS.},
