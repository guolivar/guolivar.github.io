        - The aim of this study was to quantify emission factors for urban combustion sources based on ambient measurements and dispersion modeling. The methodology used is an extension of previously developed techniques and was applied on two datasets to obtain wood combustion and traffic emission factors for black carbon and size resolved particle numbers.

      year: 2001
      description:
        - The title of the thesis was "Regional Disperssion of Oxidised Sulphur in Central Chile" and it consisted in the use of chemical transport models to estimate the impact of the $$SO_2$$ emissiones from the big coper smelters in central Chile, on the air quality in Santiago and other cities in the area.
